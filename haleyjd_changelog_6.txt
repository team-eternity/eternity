Changes since Eternity Engine v3.40.37
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/25/13

Fixed the ability to play back internal demos using -playdemo on the command
line by changing some code in D_AddFile so that demo loading failure is not 
fatal. This regression occurred when WadDirectory was refactored for zip file 
support and the system was made more particular about checking files for 
existence. 

Demos have always been allowed to float through the initial loading check and
then cause an error later if they're not found when they actually start to play.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/24/13

After initial testing of the wave loader against some randomly downloaded files,
I found that some support beyond the so-called "canonical form" will be more or
less necessary due to proliferation of the WAVEFORMATEX and extensible headers,
which many tools generate even for plainjane PCM files where neither is
technically required.

To support those header types, I also need to tolerate presence of a "fact"
chunk between the header and the data, as Microsoft's specification requires
one to exist (still, not all files will have one due to non-compliant writers,
and I don't assume that it exists without checking for it first - nor do I
actually require that it exists myself as it's not interesting to me).

This made all my test waves play back in EE, at least, so it's an improvement.
essel says use of 24-bit, 32-bit, and IEEE PCM formats are almost exclusively
reserved for high-end professional audio development, so it's very unlikely
that I'll be adding support for those until and unless someone specifically
requests them.

Noticed while pasting the code on pastie that my DMX padding check was wrong
and was testing against byte 2 instead of byte 17. Woops. Easy fix.

Enhanced the runtime wad loading dialog with capability to browse the file
system directory tree, as a Christmas present to printz who called it out as
one of his desired features on a Doomworld Forums thread. This had been in my
head as an idea for a long time (and had been previously requested by other
users), and I came up with a relatively simple way of doing it finally.

In the process of recording a YouTube demonstration of the above, I noticed that
EE had started pulling DSTINK from eternity.pke even if the sound existed in the
IWAD, which was incorrect because the IWAD is supposed to override the resource
file on the basis of being loaded after it.

Turns out that the NSG-style loading methods of WadDirectory needed to be 
recoded so that they respect resource loading order more than namespace priority
as otherwise this will become a universal problem as more code is rewritten to
use NSG-style logic (in particular when the graphics/ namespace is fully
supported through VImageManager).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/23/13

Taking further advantage of the new sound mixer, I have separated loading of
digital sound effects out of the low-level code into a new high-level s_formats
module. In addition to revamping format detection and sanitization of DMX 0x03
samples, I have added support for 8- and 16-bit Microsoft waves, in the so-
called canonical format only (not tolerating all the multiple complex possible
RIFF chunks).

Needs serious testing.

Also added proper support for the sounds/ namespace in PKE archives - EE will
look there first for sound resources, and only resort to the global namespace
when it didn't find anything there (courtesy of the NSG-style lookup functions
in WadDirectory).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/22/13

Completed an EDF data model for reverb specification.

Added back Pre-Beta Lost Souls with a ZDoom-compatible spawn number and some
tweaked behaviors that make them fit with the modern game a bit better (bright
flag on their frames, improved sprite offsets, and not leaving an ugly corpse
hanging in midair when they die).

Backed out the change adapted from Chocolate Doom to warp the mouse to the lower
right as, under SDL's broken mouse handling code, this somehow manages to 
translate itself into player motion if the mouse is unlocked without the game
becoming paused (such as during multiplayer for example).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/21/13

Implemented an optional pre-delay buffer for the reverb engine.

Added a moving average FIR low pass filter to the backend of the reverb
effect to experiment with cutting some of the high-pitch noise that is 
responsible for the Freeverb algorithm's metallic sound. Seems to work, though
is not powerful enough to prevent the metallicity at very high reverb levels.

Later experimented with a configurable low-pass/high-pass/band-pass filter, but
settled instead on a full 3-band equalization pass by recommendation of 
esselfortium, as it is the ability to variably scale different frequency bands
in a reverb effect which is responsible for about 90% of the perception of 
different "materials" in filter effects.

For example, trimming high frequencies more than low results in wood or 
carpeting, or a densely packed space (lots of furniture or people), whereas
emphasizing high gives a sense of metal and glass and reflective surfaces.

I believe the reverb engine itself is now finalized with the following layout:

   input->[opt. predelay]->[combs]->[allpasses]->[opt. 3band]->output
   
Now will begin the actually much more expansive work of integrating support for
it into the game engine, which has some of the following as subgoals:

* Tracking of "ear" data on a per-player basis, with savegame support

* Implementation of the ear "stack" so that it can be pushed and popped when
  the user interface (menu or consoles) become active, without erasing the
  active reverberation data for the playsim.

* Sector, line, and thing types/flags for control of sound environment zones.

* ExtraData support for the above as is required.

* EDF definition of reverb properties.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/20/13

Taking immediate advantage of the new sound mixer, I have started work on an
experimental reverb engine, based on the public domain Freeverb model.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/19/13

Rewrote the sound mixer loop to use floating point samples, and rewrote the
sound effect loader to translate from U8 to double precision samples. This
opens the door for:

* Support for 16-bit wave-format samples
* Realtime audio effects which would be too inaccurate or cause too many
  int <-> float conversions if mixing were being done in Sint16 format still.
  
Due to the inner mixing loop now being clip-free, the 3-band equalizer is no
longer optional, and all traces of the s_equalizer option are gone. The
rational tanh soft clipper, used on the results of the 3band equalization pass, 
is responsible for all normalization of samples.

Also rewrote the 3-band equalizer to run over the full stream with a single
function call, which is a significant optimization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/18/13

Adjusted the sound loading code to trim the DMX pad bytes - discovered during
Chocolate Strife development - from samples.

Figured out all 3 of the PSX linedef flags. A 2S line in PSX will not render a
midtexture at all unless one of line flags (512|1024|2048) are set, and when
set, those flags have the following meanings:

*  512 (0x200): Midtexture is masked
* 1024 (0x400): Midtexture is rendered with 25% additive translucency
* 2048 (0x800): Midtexture is solid

Translucent lines usually occur in the combination of (0x400|0x800), but the
other combinations occur and seem to make no difference to the line's rendering.

0x200 only occurs on lines with masked textures. I am not aware if clearing the
masked flag (or replacing it with the solid one) would cause the texture to
render with black areas instead of transparency, but it's a reasonable guess on
what might happen.

There is ONE line in MAP07 (E1M7 from Ultimate Doom) which has a midtexture but
yet has none of these flags set, and sure enough, it does not render any 
middle texture in PSX Doom. This was what tipped me off to how the flags really
work, together with use of the masked flag in maps not derived from Jaguar Doom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/17/13

Support for PSX line flags, as best that I currently understand them. I need to
do additional visual "reverse engineering" work to determine what's really going
on with them.

Added an ev_mapspecials command, which prints out information on every 
non-static linedef special that the current level is using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/16/13

Added EEPSXSpectre, which is an additive-blended spectre with an approximated
translucency level to match PlayStation Doom. He has doomednum 890.

Added EEPSXBloodyChain, which is a PSX-specific object, with doomednum 891.

Things are now translated when loading PSX format maps:

* Demons with special flag values are changed into EENightmareSpectre or
  EEPSXSpectre depending on their flags. A generic form of support for the
  nightmare flag is not available, as adding flags to thingtypes in this manner
  causes issues with features that PSX doesn't have, like nightmare skill and
  archvile respawning. It's easy enough to create a Nightmare version of a
  monster via EDF anyway.

* doomednum 64 (normally the Archvile) is redirected to 891.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/15/13

When playing maps with map numbers greater than 35 and no EMAPINFO, EE would
display a "bad music number" message at the start of each map due to a lack of
rangechecking in the function that calculates music number for map number for
DOOM II.

I have added an eclamp function template to m_compare, and used it to ensure 
that all of the default music track number generators use indices that are 
strictly within bounds.

Began work on the VImage / VImageManager classes which will represent Eternity's
new unified internal image storage format and a loader which caches lumps and
translates them into that format while hiding the details from the game engine
to the greatest extent possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/14/13

While performing a code audit to determine all codepoints that need addressing
before it could be possible for EE to render in 32-bit color, I found and fixed
up various minor issues:

* Commented-out crap all over the engine left from rewrites and refactorings.
* Expired FIXME and TODO comments.
* Dead code in the particle engine from god knows when.
* Incorrect copypasta of comments
* Code that has been #ifdef'd out since we still supported DOS...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/12/13

Converted all the old Z_SysCalloc calls in the VBuffer code to ecallocs, as
since conversion of the zone heap to a native heap implementation, there has
been no strategic advantage to putting large video buffers directly on the 
C heap.

Added basic loading support for the PSX map format, including its fixed-point
vertex and specialized sector format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/09/13

I have recoded the way that psprite scaling factors are calculated so that it
is based purely on the view window geometry and not needlessly reliant on the
renderer's field of view. This corrects the long-standing issue of weapons
floating above the status bar in high FOV and in very wide widescreen modes
such as 17:9 and 32:15.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/08/13

Added support for single patch textures between TX_START / TX_END lumps, as in
ZDoom, and the corresponding textures/ directory in PKE archives.

Added code to PatchLoader to support limited translation of linears into 
patches when one is found while trying to load a patch, as a hold-over until the
new unified image internal storage system I am planning is finished.

Once it is in place, there will be no more need for runtime conversion of 
resources between different formats. Patch, linear, or PNG, all graphics will
be converted to and drawn using one unified internal format. This will allow us
to eliminate TONS of drawing code in the V_ modules, and is an important move
toward two possible future goals:

* True-color rendering support
* True 3D GL renderer

Upstreamed some important copy construction glitch fixes for Collection and 
PODCollection from my psxwadgen project, where I caused undefined behavior by 
trying to copy-construct them in the patch conversion code adopted from SLADE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/07/13

I have removed the only partially working at best "start on first new map"
feature from SMMU, as it's always been mostly clutter and could confuse users
more than help them out.

Turns out maps with zero nodes were supposed to work, via the Doom engine's
design of returning subsectors[0] if an attempt to access nodes[-1] is made
via numnodes being zero when used in the calculation "numnodes - 1".

Unfortunately at some point in BOOM or MBF development, Lee Killough refactored
the R_PointInSubsector function without taking care to preserve this behavior.
As a result, everywhere in the engine BUT this function was already behaving
correctly in the case of an empty BSP tree.

But of course, like most things in vanilla Doom, this was subject to a quirk -
Z_Malloc returns a 32-byte block in vanilla when it asks for zero, which is the
only thing that prevented an illegal operation in P_SetupNodes.

So with R_PointInSubsector fixed and a special check for zero-size lump added in
P_LoadNodes, EE can handle these maps again. The only kind of map that can run
with NO BSP btw is a single-sector map that is perfectly convex.

Vanilla did have a separate issue that could stop maps with only one sector from
working, so despite tolerating an empty BSP tree, it could still crash on these
maps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/01/13

Removed extinct low-detail column drawer modules from the project files.

Support has been added for subtractive blending through a precalculated tranmap
(a SUBMAP lump can also be added to a wad to override this blending when we're
running in an 8-bit color mode).

Added TLSTYLESUB flag for thingtypes to enable subtractively blended sprites.

Added EDF definition for EENightmareSpectre, which is a custom monster from the
PlayStation version of Doom. He is a subtractively blended demon with double the
health - quite dangerous, taking two whole SSG blasts to go down for the count!

Being the logical and spiritual successor of MBF, I have reasserted our claim to
the ancestral territory of the 800-900 range of doomednums, which are wide open 
for use currently with no assignment in other ports. (MBF defined the helper dog
with DoomEd num 888). So, the Nightmare Spectre is available in Doom with the 
spawn number 889.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/29/13

Added support for the grAb chunk, created by ZDoom and now a virtual community
standard, which allows for specification of x and y offsets in PNG-format
graphics. This should take effect anywhere a PNG gets used as a patch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/27/13

MacOS X just happens to be having a serious crisis with toupper()/tolower() in
its standard libraries right now (how can this possibly be a "thing"???), so
I eliminated the remaining calls to them for printz and ConSiGno's benefits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/24/13

Replaced most usage of <ctype.h> functions with custom functions defined in 
m_ctype.h and placed in an ectype namespace which are guaranteed to be:

* ASCII no matter where the program is compiled, which is what the rest of EE
  expects.
* Safe whether called with signed or unsigned char values.
* Treat all extended ASCII (>127) as control characters, which is how EE uses
  them (ie. they cannot be subject to translation via toupper/tolower, nor
  considered to be alpha, numeric, hex, or punctuation characters).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/23/13

Need secure tolower/toupper calls in EE's M_Strupr/M_Strlwr functions, as GCC
4.x has started using lookup-based chartype functions that are vulnerable to the
common problem of char promoting to signed int (and of course, ZERO sanity
checking inside libc functions being considered perfectly acceptable despite the
ridiculous consequences this has for security).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/22/13

Added support for using left and right on the keyboard to rotate monster sprites
during the DOOM II intermission, as is possible in similar code on the skin
viewer, and as was allowed during the DOOM 64 cast call. Not totally happy with
the implementation because it should depend on keybindings so you can also do
it with gamepads etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/17/13

When the HUD message widget steps down its y position to account for an active
chat widget, the distance stepped is now defined in terms of the hud font's
absh value rather than a hardcoded 8 px.

Stepping of HUD messages from line to line is also now based on the absh value.

As a result of these changes, it is now possible to use V_FontFitTextToRect to
support multi-line HUD messages. This is an important prereq for Strife support,
and also fixes problems we already have with longer than usual messages getting
cut off at the edges of the screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/14/13

Removed all processor affinity hack code after extensive playtesting. No crashes
so far.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/10/13

ConSiGno noticed a regression from the menu item system refactoring which had
emulated menus' big sliders rendering a small font text string in addition to
their patch and slider - though I CODED a method named 
MenuItem::shouldDrawDescription and properly overloaded it in the big slider
class, I SORT of forgot to ever put a call to the base class virtual anywhere.
Oops!?

Upgraded Eternity to build against all of the newest trunk versions of SDL 1.2
and its support libraries. Not only has this completely resolved the MIDI loop
deadlocking issue that has plagued us since Windows Vista came out, it also
added support for FLAC music, the potential capability of supporting FluidSynth
with minimal work, and makes the old processor affinity hack unneeded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/08/13

Converted the HUD widget system into a proper class hierarchy from the C pseudo-
OOP it was still using, which was relying on type punning.

The message issued during shareware games about ignoring wads in the game 
autoloads directory will now only be displayed if there was actually an autoload
path to load files from; if there isn't one, we be quiet about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/07/13

All files and directory paths that are loaded from the game path will now
preferentially check for and load a copy that exists under user/<game> before
checking and loading one that exists under base/<game>, as user is the preferred
location for storing anything that didn't come with the Eternity install
package.

Identified and repaired some currently inconsequential undefined behavior in 
the cam_sight code where non-POD PODCollection was being initialized via memset
instead of with a constructor call. Since the object didn't have any important
virtual methods and was mostly POD-like, this was doing mostly the same thing
by chance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/06/13

Removed now unnecessary macros conditionally defining the GetWindowLongPtr and
SetWindowLongPtr functions in the i_w32main module, which were there only for 
the benefit of Visual C++ 6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/27/13

Added a manifest file to Eternity in the 2010 and 2012 projects which declares
the application to be "DPI aware," which prevents low-level scaling operations
and off-screen drawing being done by Windows. Microsoft has recommended that all
games include such an exclusionary declaration in their manifests. Special 
thanks to fraggle for researching this issue and sharing his findings with us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/18/13

Refactored all the code relating to implementation of individual types of menu
items in the menu engine to use a class hierarchy, as had been long planned and
partially migrated toward previously by moving the special behaviors per type 
into arrays of function pointers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/16/13

Added 2880x1620 to the 16:9 picklist, as it fits within the limits, and there is
at least one PC monitor manufacturer producing this display size.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/14/13

Upped the hopefully temporary resolution cap to 2880x1800 to allow for use of
Apple Retina displays at their native fullscreen resolution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/21/13

Adapted a change to the low-level input code from Chocolate Doom which warps the
mouse to a more out-of-the-way location when releasing it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/18/13

Give Lich fireballs the MF4_NOZERODAMAGE flag when they are spawned invisible by
the lich fire attack pointer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/14/13

Added an MF4_NOZERODAMAGE flag, which allows for missiles with the Heretic and
Hexen behavior of not invoking P_DamageMobj with a value of 0 damage. This in
particular affects the behavior of terrain type missiles, as noted by multiple
people, they never cause infighting in Heretic or Hexen yet did in Eternity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/12/13

Support for gibhealth property in EDF thingtypes. This field is a little bit
interesting because it depends on another field somewhat for its default value.
This gets tricky where thingtype inheritance is involved, so to make it simple,
if an inheriting thingtype changes its spawnhealth, its gibhealth will reset to
the gamemode's default gibhealth calculation. So if you inherit and change 
spawnhealth, you'll need to change gibhealth too if you had customized it in the
base class.

Heretic player death sound behavior has been corrected via addition of a Raven
player death pointer separate from Doom's. The Raven player classes don't 
necessarily make a sound based on whether or not they gibbed, but on the amount
and types of damage taken in either case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/10/13

New flags for thingtypes were added to control MBF's torque (mis)feature:

* NOTORQUE - an object given this flag will never be subjected to torque
  simulation even if it is enabled. This has been applied to DOOM objects that
  appear to float or are rooted into the ground (such as floating skulls, and
  small torches). This fixes a WIDE range of maps where this feature creates
  problems, including Sunder MAP10 where some torches get torqued off ledges and
  block your path backward through the map, and No Rest for the Living MAP03, 
  where some floating skulls fall off a staircase unnecessarily. Does not apply
  during playback of 203 demos.
  
* ALWAYSTORQUE - an object given this flag ignores the comp_falloff variable
  and will do torque calculation regardless.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/08/13

Noticed another bug while playtesting Heretic - BOOM's code to make players
make an "OOF!" sound when bouncing off of walls in icy sectors didn't exclude
dead players, so if you died and slid along the ice and bounced off a wall, 
your corpse would become quite talkative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/07/13

Split base, user, and gamepath determination code out of d_main into d_files.

Changed GameModeInfo's teleFogType field from a DeHackEd num to a thingtype
mnemonic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/02/13

Added state flags, and the STATEF_SKILL5FAST flag to control monsters who set
states to be faster during Nightmare gameplay, such as the Demon. This is 
controlled by using the "fast" keyword via DECORATE state syntax, as in ZDoom.
A possible difference from ZDoom is that any number of keywords are now 
tolerated between the tics and the action function, so that multiple flags can
apply to the same state.

This will be critical later on for Strife support, as Training skill, which 
ZDoom doesn't even bother to try to implement properly, will require a
corresponding "slow" flag that affects skill 0, on some of the same states which
in Bloodbath become faster. Such a state would end up looking like such:

   SARG E 4 slow fast A_SargAttack

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/01/13

Added a new m_compare module to hold custom comparative function templates, 
which don't require the inclusion of the massive <algorithm> from STL. Applied
the new functions in various places they were needed (mainly places already
defining MIN/MAX macros).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/31/13

Added pw_torch powerup effect from Heretic/Hexen, and did some refactoring of
the fixedcolormap handling code in P_PlayerThink to make things work cleaner.

Added code that can give pw_flight in P_GivePower.

Added a custom "ravpower" cheat for Heretic, which makes up for its lacking of
an equivalent to idbehold in the vanilla game (to get powers there, you had to
slowly cheat for inventory items, find them, and then use them).

Heretic's KEYDEFS lump now includes default bindings for flight and keylook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/30/13

Restricted lockdefs to using integer-type cvars with a range of 0 to 255.

Line type 99 in Heretic incorrectly had a lockdef binding, making it appear
colored on the automap. Added the ability to override lockdefs through the EV
binding system to take care of this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/28/13

The console command hash table build was moved to before EDF processing so that
EDF is capable of making reference to cvars in definitions.

Added support for mapcolor property inside EDF lockdefs; its value may be any
of the following:
* A 6-digit hex constant starting with # (ie., #FF0000) which will be closest-
  color matched to the PLAYPAL.
* A cvar name, starting with $, specifying a console variable which contains the
  value to use (ie., $mapcolor_ydor).
* A decimal integer between 0 and 255, indicating a palette index to use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/26/13

Added a w_hacks handler for ConSiGno's really broken otakon wad, which is just
absolutely terrible to play, and has an equally broken wad directory. Worth the
effort? Unlikely :P

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/25/13

Removed the extinct low-detail span drawer engine code.

The number of BEX pointer hash chains is now defined in terms of the pointer
table size, so that it naturally grows along with the input set size.

Linear lumps are now handled in a more flexible manner by the flat loading code
to avoid out-of-bounds reading of truncated resources.

Added a DM_KEEPITEMS deathmatch flag, which allows players to keep their current
inventory when respawning during multiplayer games. I noted this option makes
co-op a lot more fun in games like Heretic where there's just too much stuff you
need to effectively play from a pistol start every time you die. Of course since
EE's inventory system is not entirely complete yet, this currently only affects
keys, backpacks, and ammo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/24/13

For some reason SLADE turned F_SKY2 in heretic/eternity.pke into a patch, so I
fixed it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/23/13

Started work on adding Heretic's cheat codes. Added quicken, ponce, skel, 
massacre, kitty, engage, ravmap, and the "mean" iddqd cheat that kills you.

Changed from the SGI STL string hash to sdbm, which was profiled by a blogger on
the Internet to have the absolute best trade-off between speed and collision
frequency when given input consisting of the entire English lexicon. There is
one faster algorithm, but it had similar collision behavior and is significantly
more complicated code-wise, making it not worth the implementation effort.

After observing strange behavior in the "stat" memory instrumentation display
in Heretic, I have refactored the font engine to not use globals to store text
display state, adding V_FontDrawTextEx which takes all possible parameters in
a clean structure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/22/13

Added respawnat property to EDF thingtypes to fully complete support for the
Heretic fire mace - this allows items which are collection-spawned to then 
respawn at a random position in that (or a different) spot collection when 
item respawning is enabled.

Fixed Heretic mace spots to NOT be NOSECTOR, since this causes them to float in
the air when sectors move underneath them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/21/13

Refactored cheats in preparation for adding support for multiple games' cheats.

Added experimental VC2012 project. I'll probably be sunsetting 2010 rapidly, 
since there's no advantage to using it over 2012.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/20/13

Made a tweak to portal line-of-sight calculations which should improve
efficiency when the scan passes through a portal block but does not actually end
up intersecting any portal lines inside that block - when this happens, all
short-circuiting behaviors in the algorithm can be re-enabled so long as no
portal lines have been previously crossed.

Added BaseCollection<T>::checkWrapItertor. When collections shrink, they need to
reset their wrap iterator position in case it now points at an invalid location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/19/13

Found that a NOTSHAREWARE flag for thingtypes is needed due to Heretic using
unmodified commercial-version maps in its shareware IWAD, which during 
mutiplayer spawn items not normally in the episode. In Heretic, these were 
hacked out by doomednum in P_SpawnMapThing (disgusting). In Eternity, we'll 
just use a flag to control it.

ZDoom uses the presence of sprites in the IWAD to control such things, but that
isn't satisfactory to me for various reasons; ie, those objects STILL shouldn't
be available in shareware, even if somebody hacks in their sprites.

A bug has surfaced in the DOOM bodyque used to track player corpses; Heretic's
behavior when a player skull pops (removing the body that is left behind after
a short period of time) interferes with this and causes undefined behavior by
not using proper Mobj reference counting.

I have refactored the bodyque to use PODCollection, to clear itself for safety
between maps, and to use a MIF_PLYRCORPSE flag so that corpses which are 
removed via Mobj::remove can be scanned for in the player bodyque and removed
from it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/17/13

Refactored base/sounds.edf and heretic/sounds.edf to use modern EDF syntax.

Raven-style item respawning is now fully supported, with addition of the
following EDF properties:

* Pickup.Respawn and Pickup.Remove states are now supported in DECORATE-style
  state blocks to define state sequences for objects to be set to when they 
  respawn Raven-style or are picked up and will not respawn. This is different
  from ZDoom which doesn't allow this level of customization.
  
* MF4_RAVENRESPAWN flag controls whether an item respawns Doom-style (being
  actually removed and then spawned anew) or Raven-style (using the states and
  simply becoming dormant for a while).
  
* Five new action functions for controlling Raven-style respawning behavior:
  * A_HideThing
  * A_UnHideThing
  * A_RestoreArtifact
  * A_RestoreSpecialThing1
  * A_RestoreSpecialThing2
  
Remapped the DeHackEd initial_bullets and initial_health variables to affect the
specific EDF item effect definitions that those values are meant to change.

Big bug fix: the ev binding for Heretic linetype 70 was set to WR activation 
type instead of SR, via copypasta error; found randomly while playtesting.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/16/13

A Doomworld forums user noted that the Doomguy had become hyperactive on the
status bar; the face icon was updating at renderer speed instead of being based
on the game ticker. This was a minor regression caused by code refactoring for
the inventory system migration.

Parent type and class name now have accessors in RTTIObject::Type.

It is now possible to query a MetaTable for the first object of a given type by
passing a MetaObject::Type reference, in addition to the by-name lookup that was
previously available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/15/13

Support has been added for items which spawn at a random spot out of the
collection of all such spots on a map, via the EDF collectionspawn property.

Added definitions for the Heretic mace spot and pickup object to 
heretic/things.edf. 

Heretic support milestone: All Heretic objects with doomednums are now
implemented!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/14/13

Conversion of Heretic objects to DECORATE states is FINALLY finished, except for
the fire mace state (it doesn't have an object to adhere to yet).

Added qstring::empty to match C++'s std::string class.

Refactored MobjCollection to use a qstring as its hash key rather than messing
with its own dynamic string allocation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/11/13

Conversion of Heretic objects to DECORATE state syntax is STILL ongoing.

XLParser has been changed to add lumps that it parses to the EDF data source
hive so that it subject to the same behavior of never reparsing lumps it has
already parsed. This will avoid such things as duplicate SNDINFO entries being
added every time a wad is runtime loaded.

SNDINFO processing has also been moved into EDF and occurs just before EDF
sound processing, so that EDF-defined sounds with the same names can take
precedence without requiring a hacky new keyword inside the SNDINFO language to
enable that behavior. My apologies go to the ZDoom crew, as they should remove
support for the $edfoverride keyword I earlier requested that they tolerate.
EE will ignore the keyword if it sees it, as it is no longer useful.

Fixed a bug in the followcam code which caused the camera to have a groupid of
zero, which during normal play is fine, but during old demos doesn't match 
against the R_NOGROUP value (-1) that all sectors and things have at that point.

Also changed the followcam vertex sorting code to use a lambda instead of a 
function object class, now that we have C++11.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/10/13

Removed hacks to D'Sparil's states which accounted for then-incorrect sound
engine behavior with regard to cutting off multiple sounds being played by an
object.

Added support for the semi-rare beta Heretic IWAD with 3 levels which was rushed
out the door by John Romero a couple of days before the game's first release. 
This is treated as a special version of the shareware mission.

Refactored IWAD version identification code to not use an unnecessary amount of
indirection (which had historical reasons, I assure you), after it made rice
very sad on IRC ;)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/09/13

Continued with conversion of Heretic objects to use of DECORATE state syntax.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/07/13

Started addition of simplified Heretic codepointers that implement vanilla
behavior without requiring extensive use of arguments (this was originally done
partially to sidestep Heretic licensing issues and not because it was practical
in some cases).

Corrected important places in Heretic gamecode to use Heretic's wonky idea of
what 1 degree is in the binary angle measure system - the value it uses is 
actually off by roughly 40%, being 1.4 degrees instead. This makes a significant
noticeable difference in the behavior of homing missiles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/06/13

During debugging I noticed that the RTTIObject type hash was seriously
overloaded (3-4 objects on some chains), so I doubled the hardbaked table size.

Thingtypes can now define a dropitem through a multi-valued property field,
allowing either Doom or Heretic-style item drop behaviors. The existing droptype
field is grandfathered into this system as an unconditionally Doom-style drop.

Dropitems are stored in mobjinfo as a MetaDropItem object in the metatable.

All of Heretic's enemy item drops are now properly specified through EDF now
that the proper behavior is available. All uses of the deprecated A_HticDrop
pointer have been redacted from the frame data.

Doom-style drops are still performed during P_KillMobj for compatibility.
Heretic-style drops occur in the A_Fall codepointer as they did in Heretic.
This is important so that the Heretic-style drops actually toss the item, since
if they attempt to apply momentum too early, the item is stopped inside the
still-solid dying enemy that is tossing it out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/05/13

Heretic DECORATE state conversion continues with significant progress.

Another inventory milestone: ammo types are now defined as artifacts, and ammo
amounts are now tracked through the player inventory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/03/13

By request, NERVE.WAD will be recognized by its header+directory SHA-1 hash 
through the "wad hacks" subsystem and will have the ENRVMETA lump loaded for it
if it is added through -file instead of in-game via the managed mission pack
support for it. This required addition of a small system for deferring load of
mission metadata to after completion of W_InitMultipleFiles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/02/13

Heretic things.edf has had its syntax modernized to take advantage of Alfheim
dialect enhancements, and I have begun converting all of the objects to use
DECORATE state syntax.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/30/13

Fixed sudden surfacing of uninitialized memory in the IWAD picker boot-up
routine in d_iwad that could randomly cause all IWADs to appear as enabled
regardless of the actual configuration or non-configuration of paths in the
system.cfg file. Thanks again to ConSiGno and others who confirmed the same
behavior on their machines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/29/13

Another inventory milestone - armor type and effects are now defined using
item effects. Amongst other things this eliminates the ancient hack being used
to differentiate Heretic armor from Doom's, and allows creation of armor with
custom protective properties beyond 25%, 50%, or 75% absorption.

Unlike ZDoom, Eternity needs armor protection specified in terms of a numerator
and denominator (a discrete fraction), and not a floating point percentage. This
is necessary for demo compatibility, DeHackEd, and for having actual
self-consistent engine behavior (I found contradictory values in THREE different
places for the protection amount of green armor amongst ZDoom's various DECORATE
definitions... WTF is that about?!).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/28/13

P_GiveBody has been rewritten to utilize EDF health effect definitions. 
DeHackEd misc fields regarding health affect only the particular definitions to
which they originally corresponded.

Changed ALL giving of health in the game engine into P_GiveBody calls, so that
things like health bonuses and Megaspheres can be properly customized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/27/13

Another minor inventory milestone finds players' possession of a backpack being
tracked entirely through the inventory system.

Wiped out the rest of the old SMMU backpack dropping system, which would throw
out a backpack containing all of a player's weapons and ammunition during 
-trideath mode; this has been broken pretty much since 3.29 Gamma or possibly
even before, so this is just cleanup. This may be replaced later with something
resembling a player active weapon drop if the DM_PLAYERDROP dmflag is enabled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/25/13

Refactored the way item respawning works in preparation for inventory
specifications and Heretic features. In the process, I found and fixed a +10
year old bug which would cause superitems to item respawn even if the "super
items respawn" deathmatch flag was not enabled.

Inventory is now saved and loaded from savegames.

I have begun work on a new P_TouchSpecialThing function which will replace the
current one once hardcoded pickupfx become a thing of the past (this requires
fully re-implementing all the existing effect types to respect their EDF 
definitions first). The function is uncalled for the time being.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/23/13

A major milestone was passed in inventory implementation as player keys are now
completely stored and tracked via the inventory system (player->cards no longer
exists). Lockdefs are fully functional through the EV_ line special binding
system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/21/13

I was requested to add /usr/share/doom as a UNIX-alike scanning location for
IWADs.

Lockdefs support in EDF is mostly complete, with a few outstanding TODOs such
as support for automap color specification pending.

DavidPH added support for looking at the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable
while searching for Eternity's user dir, before assuming the file location is
named "~/.config".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/20/13

Added fast lookup facility for key subtype artifacts similar to the one for
ammo types. Key definitions for Doom's keys have been added to items.edf in
preparation for beginning of work on lockdefs support (the ability to specify
what keys are needed to activate a particular linedef dynamically).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/19/13

Found that my MD5 implementation has been subtly broken since it was originally
written (way back in the C versions of EE) by not using big endian numbers where
the algorithm expects them. This has been fixed and the algorithm now validates
for several known MD5 outputs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/16/13

E_GetMaxAmountForArtifact has been added to account for special cases for some
artifact subtypes such as ammo types, which can change their maximum amount
depending on such things as possession of another inventory item (the backpack
in their particular case).

Added fast lookup facilities for ammo artifacts and for player backpacks which
bypass the need to do a full table lookup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/15/13

Conversion of cfg_t's to MetaTables should not adapt default values, as this
breaks the potential for prototypical inheritance to work properly, and also 
causes MetaTables to be populated with every possible field regardless of value
specification, using a ton more memory than is necessary, and making the 
MetaTable::get* methods' capability of returning a default value unused as it
should have been.

Started work on specification of the powerup effect type, and an enumeration of
artifact subtypes. The design is a bit muddled currently, however, and may 
significantly change before it becomes actually functional.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/07/13

The ability to define armor effects is now going into place in the inventory
module. Also defined an "artifact" effect type in advance for objects that are
stored into the player inventory and not immediately used. Artifacts will in 
turn reference other item effects that determine what happens when they are
used, dropped, etc.

Basic code is now in place for storage and querying of player inventories,
including:
* Adding of items to the inventory
* Removal of items from the inventory
* Sorting of items in the inventory by their sort key (this is going to support
  Strife-style inventory where items stay in a convenient and predictable order,
  and Eternity is going to use this everywhere rather than giving any heed to
  the broken arbitrary ordering used by Heretic, Hexen, and ZDoom).
  
Improved ability to use interned MetaObject keys by adding a MetaKeyIndex class.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/06/13

Processing of pickupfx in EDF has been moved from e_edf to the new inventory
module; eventually pickupfx will be more complicated than they currently are,
and will control attachment of EDF-defined pickup effects to sprites. Currently
they still function using the fixed enumeration.

When fopen() fails during D_CheckIWAD, the error message given should call
strerror() to state what problem it actually encountered if errno is non-zero.
Thanks again to ConSiGno for perpetually causing the weirdest things to happen
everytime he runs Eternity :P

As a result of further debugging the same problem prompting the above change,
paths which fail stat() will no longer be forwarded to the IWAD picker. This 
would result in a false success message followed immediately by an error
message that was directly contradictory, which was confusing to say the least.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/05/13

Added a MetaConstString class which points to an internal static string resource
and can therefore achieve yet another form of interning by sharing its const
char * member directly between instances, rather than duplicating it inside each
instance. This class should be used any time an internal static string is going
to be assigned to multiple MetaObjects.

EHashTable's getNumItems and getLoadFactor are now exposed by MetaTable for its
key hash.

Most basic MetaObject descendants' methods are now inline for speed and for
brevity of specification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/04/13

This-const versions of EHashTable::tableIterator and its reflection within the
MetaTable class are now available, so that it's possible to pass around 
const MetaTable references and actually be able to iterate over the table. 
Iteration is a constant process anyway so this is just correction of an
oversight.

items.edf has now been added to the root base folder, as well as a game-specific
submodule in the doom folder. It currently contains some test definitions which
do nothing except allow me to exercise code in the e_inventory module.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/03/13

The item effect system is beginning to take shape inside the inventory system,
and it is now at a point where EDF can actually invoke the inventory item 
processing code. None of the definitions do anything yet, but the ability to
specify them is as always the first step toward actual functionality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/30/13

Added an E_MetaTableFromCfg function which converts a cfg_t into a MetaTable,
with optional prototypical inheritance behavior similar to a JavaScript object
hierarchy.

The hash growth function used previously only by MetaTables has been generalized
so that other code in the engine can call it. In particular it needs to be
applied to the MetaKey interning table.

New weapon and inventory modules have been added and are beginning to take shape
based on my new development plan for inventory, which will store the various
required definitions as MetaTable instances, rather than creating dozens or even
hundreds of new binary structure types or even worse, thick class hierarchies 
like the mess that ZDoom uses and result in highly restrictive behavior of
certain Hexen objects that seem to frustrate the hell out of everybody I've ever
heard discuss them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/29/13

I have done various work toward issues that are holding up dynamic weapons:

* The already-defined WPF_NOTSHAREWARE flag is now used in various places in
  weapon-related code instead of testing against specific weapon ID numbers
  (wp_plasma and wp_bfg, in particular).
  
* An up sound field was added to weaponinfo_t to account for weapons with a 
  sound which is played when they are initially brought up, such as the chainsaw
  and Heretic's Gauntlets of the Necromancer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/24/13

Removed console commands and configuration file bindings of variables related to
end-user weapon preferences, and made the current array used for looking them up
static to p_pspr.

Also removed the second row of the array, which is no longer needed. The entire
array itself is actually a contrivance at this point, but can remain in place
until the EDF weapon definitions system is able to fully specify weapon priority
order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/23/13

Various small tweaks and fixes for metatables:

* Super() ought to be used in MetaObject constructor lists, as it inherits from
  RTTIObject and thus can take advantage of that typedef.
  
* E_SplitTypeAndState, used in metastate resolution such as for the A_Jump
  DECORATE codepointer, should not tolerate use of a single colon where a "::"
  sequence is expected.
  
* MetaKey interning could calculate the hash code for a string twice in the
  worst case where only one calculation was necessary, partially defeating the
  efficiency gain of key interning. Fixed by caching the hash code in a local
  variable immediately.
  
* MetaKeys were being added the interned keys collection twice, causing lookups
  by cached key index to arbitrarily break.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/22/13

I am warming up for another crack at starting Eternity's dynamic inventory,
pickup effects, and weapon systems. This time the attempt will be done on trunk
so that it cannot become subject to branch development hell. 

To start off the process, the earlier abortive inventory code still left in EE
trunk from a couple years ago has been burned out completely.

I removed the demo-comp-optioned tweak to Lost Souls that tries to avoid 
recursion through the clipping engine when they collide with objects or walls,
via using P_SetMobjStateNC instead of P_SetMobjState, because this causes 
problems with some obscure DeHackEd methods of causing strange things to happen
when objects using the A_SkullAttack codepointer suffer collisions.

Several old SMMU features which are annoying from the standpoint of inventory
and dynamic weapons support have been removed, including the following:

* bfglook, an attempt to balance the BFG in multiplayer with mlook enabled.
  Could potentially return as an EDF weapons option in the future, but don't
  count on it.
* weapon change time; this isn't something that should be infinitely flexible.
  I could see replacing this with an instant weapon changes DM flag for the
  multiplayer nuts later.

Codepointers have all been reworked to take an actionargs_t structure, which
allows me to eliminate hackish use of a stack in P_SetPsprite to accomplish
redirecton of frame arguments to make generic codepointers work on weapon frames
in the expected way.

Eliminated attempts to prevent recursion in A_Chase, due to potential demo and
DeHackEd compatibility implications.

The UI for changing weapon preferences has been removed, as weapon changing
behavior has to become part of the game definition under EDF if it is supposed
to be able to support an arbitrary number of weapons, and different sets of them
per player class. There's no way to reflect priority between an arbitrary number
of weapons in a way that both mod authors AND end users can control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/14/13

Some forwarding methods in RTTIObject which were intended to be static were not
actually static. Apparently I hadn't actually used them yet or this would have
been obvious a long time ago.

I made some changes to the savegame code to use those newer statics, which 
pretties up the lookup of Thinker class types during the savegame loading loop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/09/13

Added the i_forcefeedback option to the gamepad options menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/08/13

I have reworked the XInput haptic effects into a class hierarchy and changed 
various details of their management, mostly to avoid unnecessary dynamic 
overhead for singular effects.

I_StartHaptic now takes two parameters instead of one, which generally reflect
the intensity and the duration of an effect.

Haptics are now updated immediately when a new effect starts, so that the effect
begins immediately; this gives a very slightly better minimum response time for
short effects.

Added haptic damage feedback.

Reworked the BFG and chainsaw effects to have better ramp-up and intensity.

Added i_forcefeedback cvar and system.cfg variable to control haptics support.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/05/13

Haptic feedback support is largely functional, with the following effects
implemented for XInput devices:

* Weapon firing kickback
* BFG warm-up rattle
* Hexen Earthquakes
* Chainsaw idling (effect is not finalized yet and I'm displeased with the 
  current intensity)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/04/13

Started work on support for a force feedback HAL, with a specific implementation
for XInput on Windows.

Gamepads advertise support for haptic feedback by returning an instance of a
HALHapticInterface descendant from their override of the virtual method 
HALGamePad::getHapticInterface().

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/02/13

Undefined behavior surfaced in use of PODCollection with structures containing
DLListItem instances - if an object is moved in memory, then the pointers inside
the DLListItem become invalid. For now, PODCollection must be avoided with self-
or mutually referential objects. The crash happened at startup while interning
metatable keys.

printz noticed that translation handling was still broken as a result of recent
changes made to wad namespace iteration - R_InitTranslationTables wasn't called
until after EDF parsing, so attempts to lookup translation tables during EDF
were not obtaining the expected namespace information from local caching static
variables - instead, it needs to go straight to the WadDirectory for that info.

The audio_buffers variable controlling the SDL_mixer sample buffer bandwidth 
must be forced to be a power-of-two. Special thanks to ConSiGno for crashing
Eternity in front of his friends by trying to set this variable to some crazy
unsupported value :P

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/29/13

DavidPH has added the capability for EE to create and find its user directory 
tree in the standard install location on Linux (and potentially other UNIX-
alikes, though this requires additional support in being able to identify POSIX
compliant platforms which we don't currently have in the engine).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/28/13

The BOOM HUD was mistakenly changed to use "yellow" color instead of "gold"; 
thanks to ConSiGno for catching it early.
