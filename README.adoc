The Eternity Engine
===================

Eternity is an advanced http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom[DOOM] source
port maintained by James ``Quasar'' Haley, descended from Simon
``fraggle'' Howard's SMMU. It has a whole host of advanced features
for editors and players alike, including:

* http://doomwiki.org/wiki/ACS[ACS], including many of ZDoom's
  enhancements

* http://eternity.youfailit.net/index.php?title=EDF[EDF], Eternity
  Definition File, a language to define and modify monsters,
  decorations, sounds, text strings, menus, terrain types, and other
  kinds of data.

* http://doomwiki.org/wiki/ENDOOM[ENDOOM] and animated startup screen
  support.

* High-resolution support (practically unlimited).

* Support for _Master Levels_ and _No Rest for the Living_, allowing
  to play them without command line options.

* Portals which can be used to create skyboxes and fake 3D
  architecture. Linked portal allow objects to pass through them, as
  well.

* http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/[PNG] support

* Aided with http://libsdl.org/[SDL], Eternity is very portable and
  runs on a large range of operating systems: Windows (confirmed as
  low as NT 3.51/95, and all the way through Windows 8.1), Linux, Mac
  OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and more.

* Heretic, Hexen, and Strife support in-progress.

* Includes the Kate monster.

Engine Wiki].

Eternity Engine is maintained using the Git version control system,
and the canonical source of the repository is available at

Compiling
---------
There are four ways available for building Eternity: CMake, Visual
Studio, Xcode files, and Homebrew, for Unix, Windows, and both
Mac OS X respectively.

Building with CMake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CMake should be capable of generating build files for all platforms,
but it is most commonly used only for Unix OSes and not
thoroughly tested outside of it.

. If you haven't already, extract the source *.zip file or clone the
Git repository, in the top-level directory you should see a
+CMakeLists.txt+ file. You should be in this directory.

. Create a new empty directory and change to it, eg: +mkdir build+
followed by +cd build+. You cannot do an in-tree build.

. Run CMake. Usually you will want to run +cmake ..+, but you might
want to change the generator with a special command, for example:
+
----
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\sdk\x64 -G "NMake Makefiles"
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizRel -G "Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64"
----

. Run your build tool. On Unix, you probably want to just run +make+.

As an optional final step, you can create a binary installation
package with CPack. For Windows, it will collect all the needed
runtime libraries and bundle it with the Eternity engine. Some
examples:

----
cpack -G ZIP
cpack -G DEB
cpack -G RPM
cpack -G STGZ
----

// Building with Visual Studio
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Quasar should probably write this.

Building with Xcode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may need Mac OS X 10.7 or more to be able to compile Eternity,
though the executable product should work for 10.6 and possibly 
earlier.

* Get the static (*.a) libraries and put them in macosx/staticlib/
They can be obtained through a ports manager like MacPorts, and are
listed below, followed by their MD5 checksums. Make sure you get the
universal versions:
+
 libFLAC.a       ef096f70c267b277da68816f1d12d853
 libmikmod.a     03228aa9fd83b0f86d75f20d4204a7c1
 libogg.a        122dd5d64951f58e08bc951807a55b82
 libSDL_mixer.a  c6a85b0f56728f3585caa2d85882c4c2
 libSDL_net.a    744d0e25f6b75ddf7be73dfd938ee0ed
 libSDL.a        44535151c6d2cf805c4d823c882649e2
 libsmpeg.a      b02d04c02c77cbdee889a0511bf58d76
 libvorbis.a     3589c39ea3c2bf0eca4647b67f9d8dee
 libvorbisfile.a 54ceadfa67aadb15eae39f68dd53aa3c
 
However, to save you the time, just download them from this
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5103936/permanent/eternity/eternity-osx-static-lib.zip[link]. Put them in macosx/staticlib/
 

* You need portable versions of the Clang C+\+11 runtime libraries.
They may need to be downloaded from LLVM/Clang's website, and built
through a process hinted by the macosx/libc+\+/libc++-builder/buildit
script file. The files and their checksums are as follows:
+
 libc++.1.dylib   b5d4b02adf73ab6350bc1f9afd0653b9
 libc++.dylib    just a symbolic link to libc++.1.dylib
 libc++abi.dylib  05f6f03908a8174511946788bc13e6e9
 
Like above, download them from this
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5103936/permanent/eternity/eternity-osx-clang-c%2B%2B11-runtime.zip[link]. Put them in macosx/libc++/
 

* Now it should build. You can choose the base project or the user-friendly
front-end ("launcher").

Building with Homebrew (OS X Mavericks and up)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The benefit of Homebrew compilation is that you don't need to "install"
Eternity like a standard Mac application. However, this will require some
extra work. You will also need to run Eternity as you would in Unix.

These instructions are written with the assumption that the user has
already set up Homebrew and the required dependencies. Please note that as
of the latest Mavericks updates, GCC is no longer required. If you are
using an older cmake release folder, you will need to create a new one.

* You will need the following libraries:
+
 cmake
 sdl
 sdl_mixer
 sdl_net
 libogg
 libvorbis
 flac
 libmpeg2
 libmikmod

* Follow the cmake instructions.
+
 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Building with Visual Studio (2012 and up)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions are written with the assumption that the user has
already set up Visual Studio.

. Acquire the following libraries:
+
 SDL-1.2
 SDL_mixer-1.2
 SDL_net-1.2

. Extract them to a folder of your choosing, eg. `C:\Libs`

. Open `Eternity.sln` from either the `vc2012` or `vc2015` folder (whichever is appropriate)

. Select 'View -> Property Manager' (if it is not there you will need to enable it from Tools -> Customize -> Commands:
Menu bar -> View -> Add Command -> View -> Property Manager)

. Open 'Release | Win32' or `Debug | Win32` and double click `Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user`

. Under the 'User Macros' section, click 'Add Macro'

. Enter `SDL1_2` for the name, and the directory you extracted SDL1.2 to as the value, eg. `C:\Libs\SDL-1.2.15`

. Tick 'Set this macro as an environment variable in the build environment' and click OK

. Repeat the above 2 steps for `SDLMIXER1_2` (C:\Libs\SDL_mixer-1.2.12) and `SDLNET1_2` (C:\Libs\SDL_net-1.2.8)

. Click OK to close the property pages window

. Right click `Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user` and select 'Save'

. Select whether or not you want to compile using 'Debug' or 'Release' config

. Select 'Build -> Build Solution' and Eternity will begin compilation. If successful, you will find it in `vc201x\Debug` or `vc201x\Release`

. Place the dependencies required (the 3 appropriate SDL dlls) in this folder, as well as the folder `base\` from the repository root
