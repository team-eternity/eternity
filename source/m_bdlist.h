// Purpose: Generalized bidirectional double-linked list routines.
//  A generalized bidirectional, circular double linked list.
//  As the name suggests, the primary distinction between this and DLListItem
//  is that the resulting list can be traversed forward and backward. A dummy
//  head node is also required.

// Like DLListItem, class is intentionally a POD and will most likely remain

// WARNING: The listHead dummy node uses its bdData field to track whether or
// not the list has been initialized. If it has not been (the prev and next
// pointers of the head must start out pointing to the list head object itself),
// then the BDLISTMAGIC constant is written there after the initialization is
// performed. Calling the static Init method yourself will clear out the list,
// but make sure you are not leaking the objects in it by doing that :)
