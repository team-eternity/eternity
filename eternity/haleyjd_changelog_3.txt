Changes since Eternity Engine v3.33.33

Partially generalized the finale system so that you can specify what type of
finale sequence occurs after a map via MapInfo :)  I needed this for my new
"Episode 5" project, which needs a just-text intermission after the first map,
but in Ultimate DOOM which didn't previously support text-only intermissions
that go to the next map (they always ended the episode).

Started research for the impending rewrite of the console. Quake 2's source code
is going to be enormously useful, for I have found that it has a significantly
cleaner and more efficient method of storing console text than any I had even
imagined (I wish I had thought of it on my own...). I added a routine to the
font engine that goes through all the patches of the font and finds the widest
character width. This will be needed to more accurately calculate the number of
characters allowed per console line.

I've also made some minor adjustments to help joe_ compile under Linux.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/22/06

Added a new ALWAYSFAST flag, which makes a monster always have -fast/Nightmare
attack speed behavior. Note that this doesn't speed up any fireballs they shoot,
however, since that is handled separately through the fastspeed, nor would it
make the Demon's walking frames half duration.

Consolidated the gameinfo_t structures for Shareware, Retail, and Ultimate DOOM
since only two whole fields differed between them. Those fields are now patched
at runtime in d_main.c. I didn't delete the extra structs from the source,
however, since it might be necessary to go back to the older setup if more
fields are introduced that differ from the Retail settings.

I also made a ton of minor adjustments that allow the port to be built with the
Dev-C++ MinGW-based development package. The worst bug I got rid of was that the
packing attributes on structures in amx.h (the Small compiler) were being
totally ignored due to interference of typedefs. I should probably change my
project to use -Wall and kill off some warnings too.

I also got the DOS build running again. Why? I dunno, nostalgia maybe? I plan to
do a full multiplatform release for the next version so that Eternity can 
definitively claim to be the last port to support DOS. The worst changes that 
DOS needed were 1) I forgot to change ENDOOM loading to be gamemode-dependent in
the DOS version of the code, and 2) there's no STDISK crap in Heretic, so that 
also has to be switched off via gameModeInfo. This was technically a bug in the 
SDL version too, except that disk drawing is currently broken and therefore de 
facto disabled there.

Figured out why flat swirling was crashing. SoM was accidentally accessing
flattranslation[pl->picnum] and using its value when it was equal to -1 as an 
addend with firstflat in the argument to W_CacheLumpNum. Fixed by restoring
pl->picnum to flattranslation[pl->picnum] after determining whether or not the
flat is swirling (swirling flats don't animate, so this works fine).

I also found out that my portal tainting system wasn't quite complete. Only the
first generation of child portals were properly reset, and portals were still
starting out with an uninitialized taint value at the beginning of the level,
which would cause spurious rendering failures the first time you laid eyes on
them (dunno how I missed this).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/18/06

Numerous issues have been found by different people in 3.33.33, so a maintenance
release will most likely be forthcoming in the near future. Work has already
begun, actually.

I found an easy way to vastly optimize the blockmap unlinking operation for
PolyObjects. During linking, the polymaplink_t's generated are now stored on an
additional single-linked list that originates in the PolyObject itself. This way
when the object is unlinked, I can simply run down this single-linked list and
delete each node instead of searching the blockmap for the links. It's so simple
that I'm plain sick that I didn't think of it earlier :P
