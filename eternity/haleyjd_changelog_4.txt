Building further on top of the generic hash, I have written the previously
planned metatable API which will enable EE to associate arbitrary information
with particular instances of structures such as mobjinfo without having to add
each object as a native structure field.

It is already possible to make use of the metatables by converting over certain
problematic, pre-existing EDF features such as damagetype states, nukespecs,
and fastspeeds to use this instead of their individual list or queue data
structures.

It will additionally almost certainly prove useful in the implementation of
UDMF, and in its subsequent exposure via the Aeon API.

A metatable is just an ehash_t which has been sent into MetaInit, initializing
it as a case-insensitive string hash which functions on metaobject_t structures.

A metaobject_t structure is an mdllistitem_t descendant which additionally
provides RTTI and an object pointer which may be either self-referential, or may
point to a different address in the case of metaobject_t's which are not
contained as the first item in a larger structure, or are not in fact contained
within the structure they link to at all.

Specializations of metaobject_t are provided for integers and strings as 
metaint_t and metastring_t. Creating these objects through their respective
APIs lets the memory management of these otherwise intrinsic data types become
more automated, and the manipulation of such fields is easier.

Again, as with the underlying hash table class, specializations can be provided
to store any type of structure or data type in the metatable. But unlike the
hash by itself, the RTTI and higher-level genericity of the metatable allow 
objects of multiple types to be in the same table at the same time.

RTTI for metaobjects is implemented with string comparison. Types are passed to
relevant functions using the METATYPE macro, which simply utilizes the C 
preprocessor's "stringize" operator, #.

An example of basic metatable usage follows:

   MetaInit(info->meta);
   MetaAddInt(info->meta, "foo", 10);
   ...
   int foo = MetaGetInt(info->meta, "foo");
   
This is just illustrative, and very basic. It is capable of a lot more, and
there are several different ways in which it can be used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/02/09

I have completed an awesomely powerful generic hash data structure, previously
created for the Experimental Rudimentary Actionscripting system which was
abandoned in preference to forging ahead with Aeon based on ECMAScript.

This hash table is built on top of the genericity provided by mdllistitem_t,
giving it chains which are double-linked lists with **prev pointers, like the
majority of EE's currently innumerable private hash implementations that it
will eventually replace. Any type of object can be stored inside it via use of
callback functions registered with the hash table which retrieve the key,
object, and link pointers and return them as void *.

Specializations are provided for objects keyed to integers, unsigned integers,
and strings. Any other possible specialization imaginable is possible, but those
three are all that I can see us needing in the future.

The second Two-Week-Bug-style problem in the last two months has suddenly come
out of the woodwork. This time it turned out that mobjinfo and states have never
been initialized to zero after being allocated. Almost all structs in EE are
now allocated using calloc, but these were still using Z_Malloc directly.

This suddenly caused E_DisposeDamageTypes to access 0xBAADF00D, the value that
the Win32 heap fills freshly allocated memory with. I guess that until now the
values in this location were always coincidentally set to zero somehow. I really
REALLY hate this kind of stuff, and I hope that it will be the last such error
for quite some time.

I am glad, however, that this stuff is exploding all over me during development,
and not waiting to spring on our users after the next release. It is a pleasant
change of pace, I must say :P

This is at least in part thanks to our direct use of the Win32 heap, and more
importantly, our previous change to eliminate use of the SDLmain library, which
allows us to use the the Debug Multithreaded runtime library, which has a 
heap checking system which puts the one implemented in z_zone to utter shame.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/01/09

64-bit portability work continues with elimination of almost all instances of
the "long" data type in preference to "int" or "int32_t" where appropriate.
Exceptions have had to be made in the Small AMX and in the implementation of
opendir for Visual C++. The former is not going to be portable to 64-bit, as
I have positively identified it writing function pointers into integers, and
the latter is meant to return a "long" in order to be POSIX-compliant. Let us
hope it doesn't matter ;)

Yet another round of GCC warning fixes have been implemented, this time thanks
to hobbs. According to CSonicGo, EE has now compiled for the first time under
GCC with no meaningful warnings (a few remain about unused functions, but these
are being generated by currently unfinished features such as ExtraData sectors,
EDF inventory, and the DECORATE states processor...).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/30/09 - 07/31/09

After severe problems with pstdint.h on GCC (GCC has non-ISO-compliant
redundant declarations of inttypes.h types in its sys/types.h file.....), I have
been forced to remove that file in preference for a Visual C++-specific stdint.h
and inttypes.h. On GCC, we will use the normal inttypes.h which is always
available now.

However, thanks to the morons in SDL, I must now globally disable VC++ warning
4142, "benign redefinition of type," which is caused by SDL_config_win32.h
unconditionally defining ISO integer types with the same types as those used by
inttypes.h.

Libraries have no business defining standard library types. SDL should be setup
to use proper intermediary types rather than defining the ISO names here, and
at the very least, it should be possible to disable these by defining a symbol
such as HAVE_STDINT_H. But no, that would be good design, and we can't have
that!

I have completed and committed the initial version of eecrashreport, which is
an MFC application that will be launched via the CreateProcess API when 
Eternity crashes. This dialog app will read crashlog.txt and offer to copy and
paste it into a new browser tab or window pointing to the Eternity forum on
Doomworld.

Do note that simply opening such a dialog from Eternity itself is considered
off-limits. Opening dialogs from inside exception handlers is beyond bad 
practice into the realm of stuff you should never EVER do. Other port authors
should take notice...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/28/09

More 64-bit portability changes, this time in the configuration file. I have
rewritten the system entirely to be type-safe, so that string pointers are no
longer forced into integer variables. Instead, defaults for various types, which
now include support for float and boolean rather than just ints and strings, are
all stored in separate variables within the default_t structure.

To keep this clean, items are now defined in the defaults array using macros, in
a system extremely similar (and in fact entirely redundant) to that used by
libConfuse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/26/09

"byte" has been changed from a typedef of unsigned char to a typedef of uint8_t.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/24/09

Began a massive round of changes which will hopefully bring us all the way to
64-bit portability. I have begun by adding a portable implementation of stdint.h
so that we can transition to using size-safe integer types everywhere that this
is needed.

The first victims were the types fixed_t and angle_t, which have become typedefs
for int32_t and uint32_t respectively. The latter is especially critical, 
because the Binary Angle Measure system relies on the behavior of 32-bit 
integers, but was defined previously as "unsigned long." On x64, long has been
promoted to 64-bit, so this would immediately cause a number of severe game-
breaking problems.

The next victims were the Long64 / ULong64 custom typedefs, which were manually
configured to resolve to various system-dependent 64-bit integer types on our
supported platforms (__int64 or long long respectively). These two have been
eliminated entirely in preference for the standard int64_t.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/23/09

An incredibly improbably-undetected error which has survived in the code for
several years suddenly blew up Two-Week-Bug-style on me today when the skin 
code started to access a NULL pointer. What should it be other than the fact
that the savegame code didn't initialize mo->info until after calling
P_SetSkin, which uses the exact same field?  I need somebody to explain to me
how this never crashed until now, because it makes no sense 6_9

Finished integration of a proper structured exception handler for Windows, to
replace the totally useless silent SDL parachute. Crash information is now
dumped in to crashlog.txt in the application's directory using routines which
are supposed to be safe to call while in an exception handler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/22/09

Cleared out some dead code, tweaked an initialization problem in txt_gui.c found
by yagisan's analysis in order to match the commit in Choco Doom, and finally,
we now clear the channel id in the low-level SDL digital sound channel structs
when a sound is stopped, so that the game engine will see an ID mismatch and 
will not attempt to further update that sound channel. This is just a safety
measure, as I've seen nothing to really suggest that this actually causes a 
problem.

I do however believe there is still a subtle problem somewhere in the sound
engine, as I swear I am getting occasional phantom cutoffs. We'll see what
happens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/20/09

Analysis of the game while stress-testing the new native heap implementation
revealed extreme allocator noise coming from P_SetPSprite. Found out I need to
keep gunaction_t's on a freelist, so that they're not constantly being malloced
and freed, sometimes several times per tic.

yagisan sent me the output of a static code analyzer (like a special compiler,
but it traces through your code and looks for logic errors instead of compiling
it into a binary).  This found a lot of iffy stuff which I have knocked out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/18/09

After some misguided and unsuccessful attempts to stack a fast-fit system on
top of the zone heap, I have decided to bite the bullet and provide an optional
native heap implementation, which can be enabled by globally defining the
symbol ZONE_NATIVE. This #if's out z_zone.c and compiles z_native.c instead.

During normal play there is virtually no difference. The zone heap and Win32
heaps have similar overhead, believe it or not. But when the game is under
stress, such as during nuts.wad, the difference is unbelievable. The native heap
never dumps cachables unless a system out-of-memory event occurs, so there is no
constant unloading and reloading of resources, and there is no unnecessary 
static limit on the amount of memory allocated with a single strategy.

The plain fact of the matter is, BOOM's zone block purging stategy is crap, and
its extreme-case behavior is pure O(N) garbage. It's a shame because the zone 
system would otherwise be sustainable.

I may in the future do another attempt at a pure fast-fit heap, but as long as
the system heap offers superior behavior, I question the need for any futher
misadventure. I'd have to be pretty arrogant to believe that I could match the
know-how and manpower that have gone into the heaps used by operating systems
like Windows and Linux.

After attempting to modify one myself, I have nothing but the utmost respect for
the people who created and maintain that stuff. They must be geniuses.

After a lot of fighting with GCC, it was discovered, again by Russell, that EE's
global define values were NOT visible to modules in any directory except the
main source directory. This was due to joe not coding any way for those defines
to be propagated downward during the build process.

This means I am now required to duplicate and maintain the list of global 
define symbols in every Makefile.am individually. What a bitch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/17/09

After being frustrated with the obviously disproportionately bad performance on
nuts.wad under a 16MB heap, I have been experimenting with the zone system.

My initial idea was to code a load factor over which purgables would stop being
dumped and the block list would not be searched, but rather the game would go
immediately to using so-called "virtual" memory. This did offer a 2-3 FPS
increase, but only once the heap was so saturated with static allocations that 
the speed of incoming allocations could completely overwhelm the savings 
offered by dumping cachables.

If the rate of allocation could not exceed the rate of reclamation, then the
system would see-saw around the load factor, and performance would plummet as
usual. This heap stuff is exceptionally difficult.

As a result of playing with this stuff, I found not one but TWO places from
BOOM where an extra BLOCK_HEADER was not being subtracted from virtual_memory,
the variable tracking the amount of virtual allocations for instrumentation
purposes. This would cause the program to appear to have a gigantic memory
leak, when in fact it was just some bad math.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/15/09

v_mode has been eliminated entirely. i_videomode now stores the user's video
mode in the form of a geom string, and the menus have been recoded to present
this string, and the option to set its current value as the default.

To support this separate default setting required fixing a well-hidden bug in
the console whose behavior I had previously noticed but could not explain.

By default the console will not set the default value of a variable when 
changing its value unless the source of the command doing the setting is
the console itself. However, the menu system has always set the command type to
c_menu, and yet it was still setting the defaults, which is the expected
behavior anyway.

Well, the reason this worked was a happy accident. In the console code, the
c_typed enumeration value was being compared against the wrong variable - cmdsrc
instead of cmdtype. cmdsrc is the player who issued the command, whereas cmdtype
represents the game system from which the command emanated. Because in a single
player game cmdsrc is always 0, this caused it to always match the enumeration
value c_typed - meaning that the entire console system only worked at all 
because of an ACCIDENT!

Fixed by comparing against the proper value, but this in turn then required a
change to the menu system - a new menu widget type is supported which sets the
command type to c_menu, and default widget types set the command type to c_typed
instead so that they cause default values to be set.

Otherwise, no changes made via the menu system would stick.

Tweaked I_ParseGeom to handle termination of the lexer while in STATE_HEIGHT.
If parsing ended here, the height would be set to the default value and you
would end up trying to set a strange video mode such as 1024x480.

With SoM's completion of the automatic field-of-view adjustment, and my 
completion of the geom-based video mode setting, widescreen support is now
finished. I have raised the rescap to its new value of 2560x1600, which we
expect to be sufficient until the next generation of ATi cards is released ;)

Turns out dynasegs need to attach to the sector of the subsector in which they
reside, rather than referring to the sector of the original linedef's
location. Not doing this apparently causes some odd side effects, but only in
certain situations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/13/09

After getting my butt whipped in a conversation with myk on DWF I fixed the
behavior of the iwadhandle variable in EE's wad system so that it is only ever
set to the FIRST IWAD to pass through W_AddFile, and not to every subsequent
IWAD.

This keeps things like loading DOOM over DOOM II working the way you would 
expect, rather than having DOOM II's maps mysteriously start to call themselves
"New Level" even though they exist in the IWAD. This was indeed a bug, inherited
from SMMU, but amplified by EE's further application of the feature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/11/09

Empty-string filenames provided to the -file command will now be ignored, to
help abate problems with Doom Builder and other utilities which can sometimes
accidentally insert empty filenames into command lines when they invoke other
programs.

This is kind of a bug on their end, but it's also a design issue on ours, and so
I think correcting it is fine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/10/09

Thanks to Russell Rice for helping me eliminate further instances of undefined
sprintf behavior in the console. I eliminated them in this case by employing
qstring_t, which also simultaneously makes this code vastly more secure and
robust. It's still a fuckin' mess though.

Removed support for comments in console scripts, because they conflicted with
the ability to use ; as a command separator and as a literal character inside
strings. I then additionally repaired the keybinding save code to surround ; in
quotation marks when it occurs as the name of a key. Due to these two problems
together, it was impossible to have any action bound to ; to survive from one
play session to the next.

Added graceful handling of errors to I_ParseGeom, in preparation for making it
Eternity's primary means of setting the screen resolution. Any error in parsing
will cause the routine to set the resolution info to a reasonable default, which
is 640x480w.

Added a new deathmatch flag on a whim: INSTAGIB! Try using this in single player
for an entirely new sort of challenge - the honest no-damage run. You could play
DOOM in a no-damage run previously, but you had to watch your health very
carefully. Sometimes it's easy to ignore minor damage in DOOM and not even 
realize it happened. With instagib, if you take damage, you die. After initial
testing, I did remove instant death for NULL damage sources, however, since
this makes it impossible to cross nukage sectors or survive minor fall damage,
things that some maps require you to suffer in order for them to be playable.

SoM noted that the Boss Brain object had accidentally been given a correct
height field in EDF. EE's policy on adoption of the correct height data from the
abandoned BOOM OVER_UNDER implementation was to apply it only to decorative
objects - nothing shootable except barrels. As a result of this error, it was
possible for your aim to become distracted by the Boss Brain object on DOOM II
MAP30, and your rockets would strike the Baphomet in the face instead of going
into his brain.

Don't ask me how this went unnoticed for so long. I guess nobody has ever played
MAP30 with comp_overunder off :/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/07/09

The old legacy -vwidth / -vheight parameters needed to use MAX_SCREENWIDTH and
MAX_SCREENHEIGHT for bounds checking rather than using hardcoded constants.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/06/09

Added long-overdue save and restore code for acsthinker_t. As a result I had to
change the location of the call to ACS_RunDeferredScripts, because deferred
scripts cannot run from G_DoLoadLevel when loading a savegame. This needs a 
serious fix when the level transfer crap is rewritten for hub support later.

I changed the way that video.screens[4] is allocated. It is now a full-sized
screen buffer allocated with Z_SysAlloc, even though only a status-bar-sized
buffer is actually required. This is just the simplest and safest way to ensure
that the buffer is the appropriate size. If we eliminate buffering of the status
bar later, screens[4] can be eliminated entirely.

This change helps open the way for the impending change to Eternity's resolution
system that will enable widescreen support.

Rescap raising has been undertaken: the new cap for testing purposes is
1280x800, which is the fullscreen resolution of my laptop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/05/09

Added save and restore code for floorwaggle_t thinkers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/03/09 - 07/04/09

Continuing the effort to move more data into GameModeInfo, I have defined a
GIF_HASEXITSOUNDS flag, and broke up the quitsounds array and mapped it through
GameModeInfo.

Added a GIF_WOLFHACK flag, which indicates that the gamemode needs the DOOM II
hack to check for the presence of secret levels. This is technically silly, but
I am being rigorous about not branching on the value of GameModeInfo->id
wherever it is practical to avoid it.

Level exit rules, previously implemented as hard coded functions called through
an array indexed by GameModeInfo->type, are now tablified into arrays of rules
that function in a cascading manner. Each rule is checked until a match is
found, and the last rule in the table is always a catch-all which determines
the default exit destination behavior for that gamemode. The arrays are, of
course, attached to GameModeInfo.

Added a GIF_SETENDGAME flag and teleEndGameFinale field which control the 
behavior of the Teleport_EndGame special through GameModeInfo.

Added a GIF_CLASSICMENUS flag which indicates support for the classic menu
emulation feature. There is no current plan to support emulated menus for any
gamemodes except DOOM-based ones, so this flag is considered part of the flags
that define the "DOOM" game type. Fixed a bug as a result of testing this that
resulted in the value of mn_classic_menus being ignored by the menu system
until its value had changed at least once during runtime.

Tablified finale defaults in the same manner as level exit rules, applying the
same design of cascading rule sets.

Fixed another bug: don't try to go to a non-existant E4M2 when exiting E4M1 in
Heretic registered version. Dunno what was up with this, it was probably just a
typo or an off-by-one error caused by the annoying fact that level numbers sent
into the finale code are off-by-one (ROMERO!!!!!!!! >_<)

Music selection routines are now mapped through GameModeInfo, though due to the
complexity of music selection, these are not tablified but instead handled with
a function pointer. The music selection methods are completely different for 
each gamemode, so trying to handle them with rulesets would be overly complex.

The particle blood effect has yet again been significantly improved. The
particles are smaller, do not accelerate on the x-y plane, spawn higher up,
fall faster, are more voluminous, can be given greater positive z momentum,
live longer, and most importantly, can use any color between the two normal
blood colors if those colors are separated in the palette by fewer than 16
indices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/02/09

I fixed the cast call caused in DOOM 2 by a call to Teleport_EndGame so that
the cast call actually occurs ;)

If you summon boss brain spots via the console, the list of boss brain spots
will now be reinitialized, so that any already active cube spitters will begin
spitting cubes to that spot. Previously, any such spots added would simply be
ignored. I'll admit I mainly did this just so that I could see the Seven Portals
fill up with 5000 DOOM monsters :)  What's the point of writing this program if
I'm not allowed to have fun? :P

After worrying some more about the fact that all the special linedefs in Hexen 
seemed to give off switch sounds, even when this was totally inappropriate, I
decided to find out what the deal was.

Turns out this was actually a bug in Eternity in general, and a result of the
change to R_TextureNumForName which allows the game to keep running in event of
missing textures. Under the BOOM switches system, if a non-existant texture is
resolved in the table, then any texture will start to match the entry for that
switch, and thus a switch sound will be given off inappropriately.

This was fixed by ignoring texture number 0 in the switch finding routine.

I have begun another massive effort to remap static data in the executable 
through the GameModeInfo structure, and to eliminate as many uses of the
gamemode and gamemission id's to branch or select behaviors directly.

This starts with the breakup of the demostates table in d_main.c. Lee
previously assembled this into one table, but with the way we do things now, it
makes more sense to have one self-contained table per gamemode, and to select
them by accessing GameModeInfo->demostates. I think it's actually a lot cleaner
now, since the tables no longer have to be padded out with NULL pointers so that
they're all the same length.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/01/09

I implemented script wait notification in the ACS interpreter, so that scripts
waiting on other scripts can resume execution. Yet more Hexen areas have come
to life.

I also implemented a "puke" console command (in reference to the Hexen cheat
code of the same name) which can run ACS levelscripts. This has proven useful,
since missing linedef specials keep some of the more interesting scripts in
Hexen from executing currently.

Thing_SpawnNoFog and Teleport_EndGame are now implemented.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/30/09

I have added a system for specification of gamemode-dependent default overrides,
which alter the values of defaults stored in the configuration file system.
This enables Heretic to specify its proper default values for, amongst other
things, automap and HUD widget colors.

OPEN scripts in the ACS interpreter were being executed too early, leading to
undefined behavior. Repaired by deferring the call until initialization of the
virtual machine is complete.

Floor_Waggle (Hexen line type 138, ED type 397) is now implemented.

Added Thing_Spawn for ACS. Zombiemen now warp in all over Hexen maps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/29/09

I finally got around to fixing one of my longest-standing pet peeves left over
from SMMU, and that's the fact that the automap timer was attached to a 
redundant variable named levelTime, which is not saved in savegames, instead of
using the normal leveltime variable that has always existed and is savegame and
demo safe.

levelTime no longer exists at all, as the automap was the only thing using it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/27/09

I cleaned up a hack in the IWAD picker subsystem which was written to avoid a
double-free due to two of the IWADs using the same titlescreen resource by
creating a W_FreeDirectoryLumps routine in w_wad.c. This routine goes down the
wad directory and frees all loaded lumps, in preparation for the destruction of
a private directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/23/09

While looking over the zone heap I noticed that if a malloc or free occurs on
a gametic ending with the LSB zero, the memory ends up getting memset to 0. This
is exceptionally harmful for catching errors, as zero is the general default
value for intialized pointers as well as most other variables and structures.

I modified this by OR'ing 1 with gametic & 0xff, so that at least one bit is
always set. It's still not fool-proof of course, but it's an improvement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/21/09

I have added a "parent" field to mobjinfo_t which will permanently remember
EDF thingtype inheritance, which will be necessary to support the virtual
behavior of the A_Jump pointer defined in DECORATE. EE has never had any such
concept of runtime inheritance behaviors, but with this addition they will now
be possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/19/09

It are my birfday!

I have defined a formal grammar for parsing DECORATE states, and have done
additional work on the parser for them based on it. I have also modified EDF
heredocs once again to require matching opening and closing delimiters (either
@" "@ or @' '@ respectively). This was originally intended, and was to be
documented as a requirement, but now it is a formal fact in the code as well.
This enables heredocs to ignore only the specific type of delimiter with which
they are started.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/18/09

states is now finally declared as an array of state_t *, so this opens the door
for making states fully dynamic and allowing them to be declared outside of the
root EDF, as most other EDF entities now function. This leaves thingtypes and
sprites as the remaining critical definitions which are still runtime-static.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/17/09

Work continues on the DECORATE state parser.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/16/09

I added a call to the I_Sleep routine inside the dedicated screenwipe loop used
when wipewait is set to "always" or "demos". This should make the screenwipe
significantly more friendly toward fraps. As it was, fraps' recording would lag
horribly during any wipe, regardless of the routine being used (though the melt
wipe was by far the worst, as it's already a CPU muncher on its own).

I have begun tenative work on DECORATE state parsing, laying out an enumeration
based on my initial draw-up of the FSA required to parse them. This stuff is
very likely to change as I get deeper into it, though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/15/09

I have eliminated all uses of pointer math on the states array in further
preparation for DECORATE states. All such statements like state - states,
states + foo, etc. now either access states directly or use the new state->index
field as is appropriate.

Added static keywords to all private automap routines. Dave Taylor never used
that keyword apparently ;)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/13/09

The Wu line drawer has been completed, with some modifications demonstrated to
me by SoM - if sine and cosine lookups are used on the amount of error in the
pixel and its inverse, for some interesting reason which probably has a deep
geometric explanation that escapes my grasp, the antialiasing effect becomes
significantly smoother and somewhat brighter than the normal linear treatment
of these numbers used in the stock Wu algorithm.

I have titled this modification the Wu-McGranahan line drawing algorithm, since
I cannot find any literature or hits referring to it, though it seems certain
somebody else would have thought of this before.

TODO is making Wu antialiasing optional. The Bresenham line drawer is still
present, since it must be used for special cases in Wu line drawing (horizontal,
vertical, and perfectly diagonal all collapse to Bresenham), so it should be
possible to use it directly, for those ultrapurists out there who object to
having a better looking automap...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/12/09

There was a tornado warning, so I threw in a quick commit just in case my house
ended up somewhere in Oz. I have started work on a Wu line drawing routine for
the automap which uses the ZDoom-style translucency table rather than the 
traditional method of precalculated color ramps, which wouldn't work efficiently
for EE since we allow customization of automap colors.

I have also added an "index" field to state_t, in preparation for support of
DECORATE state syntax within EDF heredocs. This will require turning states into
an array of state_t pointers rather than an array of state_t objects as it
currently is, and when that modification is made, it will be necessary to get
the index of a state in states[] using state->index, rather than the current
hackish method of doing state - states. state_t::index is filled in sequentially
by E_ProcessStates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/10/09

The automap boundary calculation is now sensitive to portal overlays, and thus
the edges of the map will be consistent with the map when overlays are turned
on. Previously, the normal map boundaries were always in effect, and this often
lead to not being able to scroll the map far enough to even see your own
location.

Although it is probably largely pointless now, I have repaired a long-standing
issue with the BOOM (or is it MBF?) tranmap.dat caching code which creates the
tranmap.dat file in EE's base/game folders. Lee was accidentally saving the
8-bit 256-color palette, which is 768 bytes long, into a 256-byte buffer - a
clear and simple logic error. This meant that if a palette was identical to the
palette used to calculate the tranmap within the first 256 bytes (or the first
third of the palette, in other words), it would fail to detect any change and
would use the cached tranmap with an incorrect palette, resulting in weird and
ugly colors showing up on translucent sprites.

Thanks to esselfortium for catching this in his vapor project, or it probably
would have gone unnoticed forever.

I took the opportunity to add versioning information to the header of the cached
tranmap, so that if we ever need to change its format again, EE will know to
discard files in earlier formats rather than trying to use them. This was
critical for making sure that the next release doesn't cause a bevy of 
complaints about supposedly broken translucency.

After a complaint was registered on the Doomworld forums and an email was sent
to me personally by the same person about the little-known fact that BOOM
generalized walk-over crusher line types are no-ops, I repaired them for
demo_version >= 335. It is evident enough that the lines are intended to work
if they have been placed in a map.

Jim Flynn must have left the case for them out of the switch in 
P_CrossSpecialLine, and this is not very surprising since they were apparently
the very last generalized line category implemented by the BOOM team. God rest
your soul, Jim.

I have finally gotten around to my long-planned rewrite of the automap to use
floating-point arithmetic. This brings it up to par with Cardboard for numeric
stability, so that we can now map overly large levels or overly long linedefs
with the same precision and unerring grace which we have previously had only
when rendering them. Plus on modern architectures, floating point is just as
fast and in some cases (believe it or not) faster than fixed point.

In the process of testing this rewrite, I discovered a hitherto little-known
vanilla DOOM bug - automap grid lines are lost near the left and bottom edges of
the map due to some faulty math - a minimum amount (MAPBLOCKUNITS) is added in 
which causes the drawing loop to start beyond the position of a line that is 
closer to the edge of the screen than that amount. The proper thing to do is to 
start at the closest line to the edge of the screen by subtracting the 
remainder, even if that line is offscreen as a result - an offscreen line will 
be efficiently rejected by the Cohen-Sutherland clipping algorithm and won't be
drawn. At most one line can be offscreen on a given edge with this method.

Another round of GCC warning fixes.

Ever since the thread-safety rewrite of the SDL digital sound update loop in
3.35.92, I had been hearing sample loss, as if the update loop were being barred
from modifying sounds for an unacceptable amount of time. After thinking about
it for a while, I realized that this must have been coming from the positional
sound update code called via the main loop, which modifies the volume lookup
ramps for each channel to keep them in sync with changes in the player's
relative position.

I realized that a critical section is not needed around this code, since 
changing the volume ramp pointers should not in fact affect the sound update 
loop in any serious way - at worst, the two stereo channels' volume ramps might
become out of sync with each other for an unnoticably short amount of time.
Removing the semaphore acquisition around the volume ramp modfication code
alleviated all of the sample loss and made the sound engine run smoothly once
again.

Modified EDF heredocs so that they do not require a linebreak immediately before
the terminating sequence. I don't feel this is a good or necessary restriction.

After having followed a similar course with my experimental but ultimately
abandoned "ERA" parser, I rewrote the libConfuse lexer to use a state table.
This reduces the core lexer loop to 3 lines of code, whereas it was previously
several hundred. Each state is now handled on its own, and everything is much
cleaner as a result.

SoM has completed the core integration of slopes.

I completed two new gun codepointers for esselfortium, EjectCasing and
CasingThrust. These are fairly standard object spawn and thrust pointers,
except that they behave in a way that attempts to keep them consistent with the
position of the player's gun psprite on screen, and their parameters allow
extremely fine-tuned adjustment in 32nds of a unit.

These pointers look great in first-person perspective in a single player game,
but they look pretty ridiculous in multiplayer or with the chasecam active.
This is what essel wanted though, so who am I to complain? :P

Dynasegs got another smaller optimization. I do not need to calculate the
sidedness of the polyobject origin point *unless* both of the vertices of the
seg are within epsilon distance of the partition line, since the calculated
value is otherwise unused. This was a silly thing just caused by wanting to get
the code over and done with.

While wrapping up essel's codepointers I also noticed that my previous 
modification to allow copying of arguments into the player mobj state from the
player gun state during P_SetPSprite calls was unsafe if P_SetPSprite became
reentrant. In order to safely operate in this manner, I must store the states
and their original argument values on a stack, pushing one gunaction_t struct
for every call, and popping one off the stack afterward. This makes it properly
recursive.

I added the "smart" background drawer routine which I had been thinking about
implementing for a very long time. V_DrawFSBackground will, when given the
pointer to a cached lump and the lump's size, determine if the lump should be
drawn as a tiled 64x64 flat, a 320x200 linear graphic, or a screen patch.
Patch vs. linear determination is not "smart" here - the linear graphic must be
exactly 64000 bytes, which is not a valid size for 320x200 fullscreen patch
graphics (they must be larger than that, or else they contain erroneous 
transparent areas and are not really fullscreen graphics).

I rewrote several functions to call this new routine instead of doing their own
private determination of resource types. This added support for some of the
formats where it did not exist before, as well as cutting down on duplicated
code.

Line IDs and line tags are now effectively the same thing as far as DOOM-format
maps are concerned in Eternity now, in order to bring us into compliance with
UDMF semantics and to fix what could have actually become quite an awful mess.
It is good, although humbling, to admit when you've made a design error.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I applied yet another round of GCC warning fixes today.

I also found a massive optimization opportunity in R_IntersectPoint in the
dynaseg code. The expressions I used to calculate the (a2,b2,c2) values for the
node line at the beginning of the function turned out to be, under some minor
mathematical analysis, exactly equivalent to the negation of the node line's
A,B,C general line equation coefficients.

So instead of calucating these values again, I now just read them out of the
node and negate them. Should provide a good speed boost to dynaseg splitting,
since R_IntersectPoint is called every time a seg crosses a node line.

I also added a seg length calculation to dynaseg attachment, to satisfy SoM's
new Cardboard optimization that caches seg lengths instead of computing them
every frame.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Randomized sounds are now supported via EDF sound definitions. A new random
block inside the sound serves to alias that sound definition to any one of the
sounds listed by name within the block. Random and alias resolution are 
performed simultaneously, so that random sounds can both refer to sound aliases,
and sounds referred to by random sound lists can both be random sounds, or
aliases of normal sounds, or aliases of random sounds, etc. Yeah, it's kind of
complicated. There's rarely any need to actually mix the two features, though.

I changed the behavior of the Heretic deathmatch intermission somewhat from how
it worked in vanilla because it seemed backward to me.

In vanilla Heretic, if there was a frag leader, the "wpnup" laughing sound would
play and the player(s)' frag count(s) would then flash. However, at the top, all
the players' pics except your own would then fade out to indicate who you were.

I have changed this so that your own row of frag counts is instead indicated by
a pulsing translucent yellow color block beneath the numbers, and when there is
one or more "slaughterboy," the players who were defeated by him or them will 
have their pictures fade out to indicate their loserly status. To me this makes
more sense, and looks awesome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/26/09

Finished the deathmatch intermission, and added a definition for the Heretic
wpnup sound effect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/25/09

Completed the cooperative-mode intermission statistics for Heretic, and started
work on the deathmatch-mode frags table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/19/09

I discovered that a subtle problem still existed with my new approach to
button_t sound-playing for switches which could result in the switch sounds 
jumping to global position (0,0) - this was due to the fact that button_t's
would be immediately cleared, even while the sound they just started was still
playing.

To fix this, I went ahead and implemented my previous idea of linedef sound
origins, which consist of a degenmobj_t which is positioned at the center point
of every linedef at startup (and yes, polyobjects drag this around too, keeping 
it consistent with the linedef's location).

This may open the door in the future for some new linedef-based features, an
area of DOOM-editing which I do not think has been exploited to even a fraction
of its potential by any port so far.

Esselfortium found that Eternity could crash when less than 17 members were a 
part of the cast call sequence. A small logical error lead to some very
selective trashing of memory near the castinfo array. This was due to use of 
OLDCASTMAX without checking if numcastinfo was less than that value when
populating cast members with the default names defined via BEX strings.

Also, the screen clear routine in the IWAD picker module was always resolving
RGB (0,0,0) to a surface-format color value on every call because I forgot the
keyword "static" before the firsttime variable's declaration. I fixed that up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/31/09

While trying to play an interesting PrBoom 2.02 demo posted on Doomworld where
a Pain Elemental is fooled into killing a Boss Brain whilst trying to attack a
Revenant while the player is dead, ending the level, I discovered that a simple
logic error in MBF's comp vector handling prevented such demos from synching
artificially. Basically, if the demo was recorded with "compatibility," the old
BOOM setting, disabled, then MBF's logic would set the entire comp vector to 
"false," including any comp vars that didn't exist as of 2.02. This was just
plain wrong.

The proper action is to set all the comp vector values that were included as
part of "compatibility" originally to the state of that variable, and to set any
newer ones to true unconditionally. Eternity should have excellent PrBoom 2.02
demo compatibility so long as the demos in question are not for maps that use
certain BOOM features - friction, mainly.
