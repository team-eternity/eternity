The libConfuse lexer was still calling qstring::getBuffer to put its value into
the const char *mytext, so I changed all of these calls to qstring::constPtr
while I was looking over the module.

For the purpose of applying them toward the restrictedto and forbiddento fields
of the EDF inventory record, I have modified the libConfuse parser state
machine to allow CFG_LIST items to omit the formerly required braces. This 
will allow indefinite-length lists to use the same apparent syntax as MVPROPs,
which have the disadvantage of not allowing an arbitrary number of arguments.

Example:

   forbiddento Fighter, Cleric
   
This would mean the same as the successively more verbose options:

   forbiddento { Fighter, Cleric }
   forbiddento = { Fighter, Cleric }
   
This also automatically applies to addition lists, although the += is required
in that case as it would otherwise be considered a straight assignment:

   forbiddento += Mage

Merged from trunk to pull in the critical fix to logic in p_pspr identified by
Xaser during Hacx testing.

With a tornado bearing down on OKC, I made an emergency half-finished commit 
containing code for a name in each descendant-class instance of 
InventoryGeneric, primarily for use from MetaInventoryClass::toString.

The ever-growing skeletal code for executing item pickups has also grown
significantly and now calls to the not-yet-functional IsValidPlayerClass that
will check the collector against any class restrictions in the inventory def,
and has additional control flow in place for calling functions that do not
exist yet but are planned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added inventory flags PICKUPIFANY and LOUDPICKUPSOUND. The former allows an
inventory type to specify that an item giving it should be collected if the
collector can benefit from any one or more of its effects. The alternatives are
ALWAYSPICKUP, matching ZDoom, which means that the item will be collected even
if none of its effects can be applied, and the application of neither of these
flags results in an inventory item for which all effects must be applicable
before it can be collected (or it must fit into the inventory, at least).

The latter flag seems to be a newer feature in ZDoom that makes item pickup
sounds play without attenuation. I guess this is handy if you'd like to make
a Cyberdemon Sphere or something? :P

Added fields restrictedto and forbiddento, to match ZDoom with the ability to
control the acquisition of inventory items by player class, which will be 
needed for Hexen support. There is no processing code for these fields yet.

Added the p_inventory module to house code for the actual giving, taking,
dropping, etc. of inventory items by Mobj instances at runtime.

In the process, I also wrote some new generic algorithm code which applies to
MetaTables, including the template functions MetaForEach, MetaPredicateAny,
and MetaPredicateAll.

The first runs a given method on a given object, passing the method each 
item in the table matching the indicated key and type.

The second two will call the method on the object again for each matching
item in the table, but only until the callback method returns false in the All
case or true in the Any case. These are short-circuiting logic functions, 
hence the 'predicate' in their names.

I changed the storage of inventory classes in the inventory item MetaTable so
that a MetaInventoryClass object is created that points directly to the static
singleton instance that is instantiated in p_inventory.cpp that corresponds to
that EDF inventory class. This reduces the need for extraneous indirections and
lookups in the p_inventory code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merged from trunk to pull in some patches by DavidPH (see trunk changelog).

I added overloads to several methods of MetaTable which take a MetaObject::Type
pointer instead of a type name, allowing significantly faster type comparisons.
As a result, I changed most of the instances of METATYPE() in the engine into
RTTI() macros.

I also noticed that DavidPH's templated version of the RTTIObject::Type method
FindType would crash if the call to the non-templated version of the function
returned NULL for a query against a non-existent type, and fixed it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/26/2012

I have reimplemented the pickupitem array in terms of a mapping from sprites
to inventory_t definitions, partially enabled through the prior changes to
inventory definitions. This will be used to support attachment of sprites to
pickup effects for compatibility purposes.

I changed the default value of giveitem in the thingtype options to "NONE" to
avoid 161 warnings from EDF about a missing inventory type "".

I have also modified the addition of classtype properties to the inventory
metatable to avoid duplicate classes, as the classtype metaproperty will be
used to drive the giving of actual effects and inventory items to the player
in P_TouchSpecialThing via metaproperty iteration.

After looking at the ZDoom wiki again, I noticed I had omitted support for the
lowmessage value, which determines how little health you must have before you
will be given the lowmessage instead of the normal pickup message for the item.
I resolved this by changing health.message into a multi-valued property with
fields value and message.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/25/2012

After realizing the various problems that implementation of multiple effects
per inventory definition would have if implemented in the way that I started
yesterday, I rewrote that work immediately and have changed the inventory
definition itself so that it is capable of compositing the effects of multiple
inventory "classes" via use of the MetaTable in the precise way that it was
originally conceived - the addition of class types to an inventory definition
is exactly the same as the amalgamation of multiple prototypes in JavaScript.

To allow this, I have to depart from the ZDoom model further than planned and
disambiguate the semantically important and non-universal fields of each 
type. For example, in ZDoom, the Health class reuses the generic inventory
amount and maxamount to mean different things. Eternity instead now has two
additional fields known as health.amount and health.maxamount, which only
ever affect the action of the inventory definition on health. Amount and
maxamount in the inventory base structure are only for controlling the carrying
capacity of non-instant-use inventory items.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/24/2012

With an eye toward changing the design of inventory to allow multiple effects
to be applied with the collection or giving of a single item, I have defined a
new MetaObject called MetaGiveItem. My plan is to allow any number of these
records to attach to a thingtype or sprite. I added a giveitem property to the
EDF thingtype record, with the CFGF_MULTI flag set to allow any number of them
to be defined.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/21/2012

I removed all the dead code for pickupfx that resulted from the previous
revision and merged in changes from trunk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/20/2012

I have kicked off inventory-branch with the previously planned redaction of the
pickup effects array feature in EDF used to bind item effects to sprite names.
It was determined that no extant working modifications for Eternity made use of
this misfeature, and so removing it will not represent a compatibility issue.
For now it is still syntactically accepted, and could in fact be restored in
the future if I find it easy enough, but right now I'm not making special plans
to accomodate it.

This has disabled all SPECIAL item behaviors on this branch for the time being.
You are still able to collect items, but they do nothing - no effects, no
messages, no palette flash, and no sound. All of these are basic inventory item
properties that need to be retrieved from EDF.
