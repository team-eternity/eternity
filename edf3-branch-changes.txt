01/16/12

DECORATE states did not set the state_t::oldaction member which is critical for
the functioning of DeHackEd. This caused a significant game-breaking regression
for HACX which was stumbled upon by DavidPH while testing the network code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/15/12

When calculating the network packet checksum, do not write it back into the
netbuffer structure until it is verified to be valid. This might improve
behavior somehow, though it should really have no effect if everything is
otherwise working the way it ought.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/14/12

I am working on adding support for Risen3D's MUSINFO lump, now that it is 
supported by both ZDoom and prboom-plus, and is used in the new Memorial wad 
for DOOM II which is otherwise completely Eternity-compatible.

In advance of this, I need to support sector actions like ZDoom has, since the
MusicChanger object is a special case of a "player enters sector" action. I 
will be allowing type 9998 as "EESectorActionEnter" at the same time.

Some problems have been identified in EE's peer-to-peer networking code and I
am trying to iron them out. Two fixes so far:

  * When sending the startup packet, the size of the game options should be
    added in, not assigned to packetsize.
  * -net should not crash the game if given less than two parameters
    (anarkavre!!!! >:O )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/13/12

Advanced menu filebox selection widgets should not be launched when the file
list is empty. This avoids the crash mentioned in the 1/12 entry below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/12/12

Most calls to EHashTable<>::initialize have been eliminated throughout the 
engine in preference to use of the new parameterized constructor.

I found a bug whereby the mn_selectmusic menu could start out empty, and if you
tried to use it, the game would crash. I have to make sure that the static
music definitions are added to the music hash table at startup always, and
cannot be missed due to a music-playing error.

The fact the menu crashes is a separate issue that I will look into later.

MobjCollection objects can now be managed by a global MobjCollectionSet class.
I intend to use this to make the definition of mapspot collections, such as
those used by the Boss Brain in DOOM II and D'Sparil in Heretic, defined via
EDF and extensible to additional object types. This will allow me to add the
Mace Spots from Heretic, which are the last missing thingtype with a doomednum
in that game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/11/12

EHashTable will now self-initialize, in much the same fashion as qstring, if
objects are added to the table before it has been explicitly initialized. An
additional constructor has also been added which accepts the number of chains
to start the table out with, and this constructor also results in immediate
initialization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/08/12

Two additional steps were needed for fully dynamic thingtypes:

  * Caching of thingtype lookups throughout the engine, mostly in action
    routines, had to be eliminated, as was done previously for states. (Note
    this does not include the caching mechanism of argument lookups, which 
    has a mechanism for resetting all evaluations when EDF is processed at
    runtime).
    
  * GameModeInfo->teleFogType is resolved at runtime instead of at startup.
  
A bug was additionally fixed which caused a regression in G_CheckDemoStatus
whereby the demo loop would continue after playing a single demo from the
command line: the function G_ReloadDefaults changes the value of the singledemo
variable, and so it needs to be cached in a local across the call to that
function in G_CheckDemoStatus, or else it "forgets" that it was in singledemo
mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/04/12

I adjusted the MetaObject copy constructor to be safe if it is trying to copy
over itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/03/12

My Internet was down all weekend due to my DSL apparently shorting out on a bad
terminal contact, so I was able to complete a large amount of work:

  * const_cast is no longer used anywhere to get around passing const char *'s
    which actually point to heap-allocated values into efree() to free them.
    Instead, structures with this problem have additional members that point
    to the heap-allocated value and serve to track it for purposes of freeing
    and reallocation separately from the const char * that is used to access
    it otherwise.
    
  * Added an e_dumpstate command so you can look at states as defined by EDF in
    the console.
    
  * DECORATE state blocks may now be used to populate a set of consecutively
    pre-defined global states in EDF. A firstdecoratestate member has been 
    added to the EDF thingtype block to specify what the first global state a
    thingtype should start filling in with its DECORATE states is. Note that
    this property is "immediate" - it is not stored in the thingtype, and it
    is NOT inherited by child types, as that simply wouldn't make sense.
    
  * libConfuse now keeps track of the displaced copy/copies of a section when
    it overwrites a section with a newer section of the same name, instead of
    freeing and destroying the previous definitions.
    
  * The previous change allows for displaced thingtypes' DECORATE state blocks
    to still be processed. This is required when an EDF thingtype overrides one
    of the default thingtypes, since if they didn't get their DECORATE state
    block processed, they would never fill in the global state blocks either
    and DeHackEd and older EDFs would stop working as a result.
    
  * Added a +decorate flag to global EDF frame definitions, which is required
    to be present in order for DECORATE states to overwrite that frame. If a 
    frame is modified first by a global EDF frame definition, it will clear 
    this flag.
    
    This is required to keep the ability to override global frames by
    redefintion. Otherwise, they'd always get overwritten by the original data
    when DECORATE-format states are parsed into them.
    
  * doom/things.edf and doom/frames.edf have been refactored to use DECORATE
    state format. Heretic will follow soon. Hexen and Strife definitions will
    start out in this format eventually.
    
  * Inventory inheritance and basic field processing are now functional.
  
  * Added an E_ReplaceString utility, which frees the current value of a char *
    if it is valid and then assigns it a new value. This can be used like the
    following example:
    
    E_ReplaceString(foo, estrdup("bar")); // if duplicating a non-dynamic value
    E_ReplaceString(baz, qux);            // if 2nd param is already dynamic
    
  * The development version has been bumped up to 3.40.21 and the name of the
    next version will be "Midgard," which is the Norse mythological name for
    the Earth, meaning literally "middle earth" (familiar?).
    
    Middle Earth is where humans live, and it is supported by the trunk of the
    great world tree, Yggdrasil. It is "middle" on account of being between
    the various other nine realms of existence, amongst them Asgard, the home
    of the gods, and Jötunheimr, the home of the giants. Being in the middle,
    it is naturally where all the other beings meet to fight and end up making
    trouble for humans rather than minding their own business :P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/31/11

Merged changes from trunk to pull in fix to white startup screen in GL2D mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/29/11

Merged changes from trunk to pull in support for hi-def music.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/23/11

The ThinkerType hierarchy has again been altered to eliminate the need to
specify a Thinker's parent class inside the IMPLEMENT_THINKER_TYPE macro, 
which is away from the class definition inside a source file.

Instead, the parent class is now specified in the DECLARE_THINKER_TYPE macro,
inside the Thinker descendant class definition in the header file.

The following typedefs are created as part of this change:

  * All Thinker descendants define a Super typedef that refers to their 
    immediate parent class (ie. Mobj::Super is equivalent to PointThinker,
    and PointThinker::Super is equivalent to Thinker).
    
  * All ThinkerType descendants define a Class typedef, which refers to the
    Thinker descendant class for which they serve as an RTTI "whipping boy."
    (ie. MobjType::Class is Mobj, and PointThinkerType::Class is PointThinker).
    
As a result of these changes, there is no longer a need for startup code to
dynamically lookup the parent type of each class in the ThinkerType hash table.

Instead, a virtual ThinkerType *getParentType() method in ThinkerType classes
is able to simply return Class::Super::StaticType. The StaticType member of
each Thinker class was already used to refer to its ThinkerType instance and
is initialized at startup as the ThinkerType objects construct themselves.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/22/11

Added a call to E_ProcessInventoryDeltas to main EDF processing.

Merged code from trunk to process SNDINFO music definitions, and altered it
accordingly for edf3-branch changes to the EHashTable API.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/20/11

metaapi.h must include DLListItem; I have no idea why only certain compilers
could get away without it while others object.

MetaTable instantiation and delta section processing have rendered the basic
inventory definition section of EDF parsable and processable (still doesn't
really DO anything, of course), and so I have added call downs to the new
module's routines in e_edf.cpp.

configure.in changes were merged in from trunk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/18/11

Since inventory definitions are completely dynamic from the get-go, I have 
determined that the inventoryDefs array is completely unnecessary and thus I
have eliminated it and all "GetNumForName" style routines, which now return
a pointer to an inventory_t structure instead of an index into inventoryDefs.

ThinkerType RTTI has been altered to use case sensitive name hashing, since the
identifiers it is based on are also case sensitive at compile time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/17/11

Merged changes from trunk to pull in the fix to "goto" being treated as case
sensitive inside DECORATE state blocks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/12/11

After additional thought about the way that inheritance should work in the
presence of dynamically changing thingtypes, I determined that the proper
course of action to take is to always create a new mobjinfo and let it override
the one previously defined through the "last-added-is-first-found" semantics of
EHashTable, which were precisely created originally to allow this behavior.

This allows thingtypes that inherited from a type altered later in dynamically
loaded EDFs to retain their proper behavior, as they continue to point to the
old, displaced mobjinfo as their parent type, including any DECORATE states it
may possess in its MetaTable.

The rest of the game engine will see the newly defined thingtype when it is
looked up via E_ThingNumForName and friends.

DeHackEd number hashing works again (it was temporarily broken due to some
mistakes).

Inventory reallocation routines E_CollectInventory and E_ReallocInventory have
been added, matching like-named routines for thingtypes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/03/11

Elimination of the assembly version of D_abs was merged from trunk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/28/11

Additional changes have been merged from trunk, with some following changes 
made to hash tables defined in this branch that don't exist in trunk yet
necessitated by more changes to EHashTable, as suggested by DavidPH, which
resulted in elimination of passing the pointer-to-members to the class
constructor in preference of passing them into the template as parameters.

Another -timedemo increase was noted as a result of this change, since it
enables the templated EHashTable to incorporate the pointers to members as
constants at compile time and bake them into the code itself, with full
optimizations, instead of accessing them at runtime as if they're variables.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/26/11

The change to the semantics of the E*HashKey classes has made the inclusion of
the e_hashkeys.h header file unnecessary in many locations.

I have merged changes from trunk, including the addition of hal/i_platform
defines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/23/11

DavidPH suggested another modification to EHashTable which would have the 
E*HashKey interface classes use static methods. 

As a result of this change, which did result in an extremely small but
consistent boost in -timedemo mode, I needed to make the names of states and
mobjinfo definitions fully dynamic, so there is no longer any mnemonic length
limit for these sections in EDF.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/22/11

A functional inventory system is the next major milestone for edf3-branch.

I have added hashing for inventory definitions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/21/11

With the following list of changes, EDF has become fully dynamic:

  * sprite variables can be set more than once
  * pickup items are additive
  * castinfo can be defined more than once (the new cast entirely replaces any
    existing one, however, since castinfo is a singular resource)
  * boss spawn types can be defined more than once, with the same caveat as
    for castinfo
  * EDF processing for the initial root parsing and for runtime additive
    parsing has been folded together into a single routine, as earlier planned
    for once all sections became properly dynamic.
    
I also found and fixed yet another problem with castinfo whereby F_CastPrint
could cause an access violation if any of the castinfo entries after the first
17 had an undefined name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/20/11

ThinkerType RTTI is now fully functional. I have observed an average gain of 
1.2 FPS in -timedemo ran on Sunder MAP11 allowing the default DEMO1 lump to
load and play - which is the DEMO1 from the IWAD, and features the player
wandering around in the first room shooting at walls while thousands of demons
grunt and growl outside - every one of them generating at LEAST one and 
possibly several dynamic_cast calls per frame.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/14/11

I have completed a previously planned revamp of the ThinkerType class hierarchy
so that it supports inheritance information. With some additional minor 
changes, this will enable EE to use these classes as its own form of RTTI in
preference to C++'s built-in mechanisms. With a simple test program, I found
that employing your own custom RTTI solution to implement a dynamic_cast
equivalent operation results in up to ten times faster code in Visual C++.

It is unfortunate that the C++ object model is not only so minimal, but also
at the same time so broken on account of having to support hateful features 
such as multiple inheritance and virtual inheritance. These make dynamic_cast
and the obtaining & using of pointers to members significantly more complicated
than any basic, clean, and properly designed code needs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/12/11

A bug was found in EE where if you started out in a position where you could
only see HOM, a segmentation violation would occur. This happened because the
drawsegs_xrange table would not be allocated until at least one drawseg was
added to it. If there were NO drawsegs, the pointer stayed NULL unexpectedly
and the renderer would crash trying to access it without checking.

This was fixed by making sure drawsegs_xrange starts out with room for at least
one drawseg allocated, instead of starting out NULL. This resolves the crash in
sargezar.wad MAP10 when -warp is used to go to that map directly.

This ideally should have been done on trunk, but I have decided that
edf3-branch will, to the greatest extent reasonable, serve as the development
branch for the next version of EE, to ensure that it does not end up back-
burnered and ignored in favor of other projects. This means that most fixes
and other changes will be occuring in this branch for a while, instead of on
trunk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/06/11

Dynamic mobjinfo has been largely completed and tested to work at a basic
level, so the first major milestone is complete.

  * thingtype definitions are now recognized during runtime EDF parsing.
  * inheritance is now more friendly to dynamic definition, with generation
    tracking (a generation being each individual EDF parsing process).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/05/11

E_IsMobjInfoDescendantOf has been optimized by altering it to return a pointer
to the parent type (or NULL when the type in question does not inherit from the
indicated type). This prevents the need to immediately lookup the parent type
using E_ThingNumForName when it was already iterated over in the process of
answering the inheritance question.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/04/11

Again exactly as was previously carried out for states, I have made mobjinfo
hashing fully dynamic via use of EHashTable, and I have changed the return 
value from mobjinfo lookup functions that means "no such object" from
NUMMOBJTYPES to -1, so that its value need not change at runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/03/11

I have created a new branch to continue development of EDF 3.0 features, which
may require significant refactoring that will render the branch unbuildable or
create temporary regressions and functionality gaps that wouldn't be acceptable
on the trunk build.

The first significant project for edf3-branch is the goal of fully dynamic EDF,
so that no definition types are treated non-additively or are ignored when
loading EDFs at runtime.

The first step on that road is to make mobjinfo fully dynamic. As with states
during edf-branch (which resulted in EDF 2.0), I have begun by turning mobjinfo
into an array of pointers to mobjinfo_t structures, instead of a solid array.
For cache coherency, the actual mobjinfo structures are still allocated as
contiguous blocks during each EDF parsing.
