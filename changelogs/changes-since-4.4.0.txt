Changes since v4.04.00
======================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed wrong version display in the title bar.
* Fixed corruption happening after trying to play an unsupported demo, such as coming from
  DSDA-DOOM. This affects projects such as Eviternity II.
* Fixed Heretic autoswitching weapons wrongly when having the Tome of Power.
* Fixed crash happening when inheriting or applying a delta structure on a powered-up weaponinfo.
* Fixed unintended NOHITGHOSTS on Heretic gauntlets weapon.
* Fixed powered dragonclaw starting displaced a few meters from player.
* Fixed jerky and visually imprecise polyobject movement (bug introduced in v4.04.00).
* Fixed exaggerated and unrealistic slope bouncing of objects under gravity.
* Fixed attach-3dmidtex specials from quitting Eternity. This was happening on WADs like Hell Ground
  where there were mistaken linedef specials such as 281 or 282.
* Fixed the close button of the IWAD picker window not working. Thanks to FozzeY for the pull
  request!
