Changes since v4.04.02
======================

Improvements
------------
* New lindef parameterized special: Sector_ChangeFlags. Only the flags supported by Eternity are available.

* The ThrustThing linedef special now uses its third parameter: "nolimit" to allow speeds greater than 30.

* New ACS function: SetLineActivation.

* Automap improvements: now you can zoom in with the mouse wheel on the automap. You also have the option to hide all 
  stats from both the automap and the overlay HUD, and hu_hidesecrets only hides secrets. Special thanks to 
  SarahCosmosys for the contribution!
  + New console variable for this purpose: hu_hidestats.

* Now the 'gib' state of the crushed corpses is customizable in EDF in the following ways:
  + in EDF `thingtype`, using the `crunchstate` property;
  + in EDF `thingtype` DECORATE-style `state` definition, using either the `Crunch:` or `Crush:` label (the latter is on 
    par with the name from ZDoom).
  If unspecified, it will default to the game mode behavior: change to S_GIBS in Doom, or do not change in Heretic. 
  Thanks to sink666 for the implementation!

* Frames with dehackednums 1085-1088 are now defined as placeholders just like the DEHEXTRA set, because some mods would
  error out in Eternity but not in other ports. Thanks to aaaqqqddd for the heads-up.

* EDF startup warnings are now always displayed, no more need for -edf-show-warnings.

* Added EDF startup warning in case of missing skinsprite, or one which user didn't add to spritenames.

* macOS: now all the files available in the "add file" dialog box are available for drag-dropping or "opening with" from 
  Finder.

* Minor improvements with portal error messages.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed crash happening when changing multithreaded rendering number of threads before demos start.
* Fixed sprite glitching shortly followed by crash when starting with multithreaded renderer on a small view, and then 
  increasing the view.
* Fixed strange failure to start, happening on some Windows installations because of changes in the runtime.

* Fixed bug with UDMF attached surfaces happening on unrelated sectors.
* Fixed sudden termination due to "texture not cached" when playing back multiple level demos, or when the r_precache 
  cvar was off.
* Dehacked patch Frame omitted Args* fields didn't resolve to defaults, but 0. This was wrong compared to how ports such 
  as DSDA-DOOM should handle it.
* Fixed A_ConsumeAmmo bug when specifying 0 (ammo per shot) ammo.
* A_BFGSpray no longer crashes when used on a non-projectile thing which didn't acquire an enemy yet. This makes it 
  compatible with vanilla DOOM Dehacked mods which can use this codepointer liberally.
* Fixed bug with player melee attacks not being portal aware when adjusting angle towards target.
* Fixed slopes blocking access when on the other side of one-sided linedef wall portals. 
* Fixed wrong 3dmidtex physics when on sloped lines.
* Fixed imprecise dynaseg splitting at high XY coordinates, with bad side effects such as polyobject portal infinite 
  rendering recursion (and the "refused to draw portal" error popping up).
* Fixed wrong sprite sector portal clipping when scaled differently from 1.
* Fixed a possibly harmless access violation happening when rendering middle textures at a certain distance.
* Fixed phantom sprite cloning when moving in a polyobject cabin with floor and ceiling portals also going outside.
* Fixed demo desync caused by missing par time counter in the intermission.
* Fixed harmless access violation happening in demos when getting harmed or killed by a destroyed lost soul.
