Changes since v4.05.04
======================

Features
--------
* Added support for the "author" property in UMAPINFO.
* Added DEMOLOOP id24 lump support.
* Added support for non-power-of-two flats.
* Added new ACS function: GiveInventory.
* Added a parameter to A_VileTarget codepointer: thing type to spawn (defaults to the one with Dehackednum 5, i.e.
  "VileFire" in Doom). Thanks to sink666 for the wish to have this parameter in the pull request.
* Made A_VileAttack codepointer paremeterized. Added the following args:
  - sound to play (default: sfx_barexp)
  - initial damage (default: 20)
  - blast damage (default: 70)
  - blast radius (default: 70)
  - thrust factor (default: 1.0)
  - damage type for initial hit (default: actor's MOD)
  - damage type for blast (default: actor's MOD)
  Thanks to sink666 for the wish to have parameters in the pull request.
* Added damage type (MOD) argument to A_BFGSpray (default: BFG_Splash).

Improvements
------------
* Loading broken or wrong save game files is more robust now, though not perfect.

Bug fixes
---------
* Fixed A_BFGSpray not using the parameter, and always being locked at 40 rays.
* Fixed bad rendering of specially paletted PNG file for the Heretic episode 2 ending screen.
* Fixed bad implementation of TakeInventory.
* Fixed A_CustomPlayerMelee wrong implementation of the angle deflection argument. Now it properly avoid rotating player
  if set to "none". Thanks to sink666's pull request for the catch.
