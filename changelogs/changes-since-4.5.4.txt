======================

Features
--------

* Added DEMOLOOP id24 lump support.
* Added support for non-power-of-two flats.
* Added new ACS function: GiveInventory.
* Added a parameter to A_VileTarget codepointer: thing type to spawn (defaults to the one with Dehackednum 5, i.e.

  - blast radius (default: 70)
  - thrust factor (default: 1.0)
  - damage type for initial hit (default: actor's MOD)

  Thanks to sink666 for the wish to have parameters in the pull request.
* Added damage type (MOD) argument to A_BFGSpray (default: BFG_Splash).
* Added the comp_thingsectorlight setting, which controls how things are lit in sectors with different floor and ceiling
  lights. Thanks to elf-alchemist for the contribution! Details here: https://github.com/team-eternity/eternity/pull/740

Improvements
------------
* Loading broken or wrong save game files is more robust now, though not perfect.

  for the contribution! Details here: https://github.com/team-eternity/eternity/pull/741

Bug fixes
---------
