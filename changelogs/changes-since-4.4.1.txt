Changes since v4.04.01
======================

Small improvements
------------------

* Confirmation yes/no views (such as for quitting) now accept non-QWERTY keyboard layouts for 'y' 
  and 'n', i.e. the same keys which under QWERTY would be 'y' or 'n' will also work.
* Do not terminate suddenly if user put flag names in the MBF21 flag codepointer. Just display an
  in-game error message with sound. Also, the message is more accurate.
* Explosions now trigger splashes on BOOM deep water surfaces by comparing their heights to the 
  water surface, not to the solid surface beneath.
* Splash terrain types now work with portal overlays.
* Heretic Fire Mace projectiles now blow up when hitting anything under Boom water, without
  bouncing, so as to behave consistently with shallow Heretic water. Currently this doesn't apply to
  linked portal water however.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed A_JumpIfFlagsSet as it was completely broken.
* Fixed wrong defaults in A_WeaponBulletAttack.
* A_SkullRodStorm wasn't line portal aware.
* Fixed UMAPINFO not recognizing spec-defined Deh_Actor_145 to Deh_Actor_249
* Multithreaded rendering now renders very wide sprites properly (such as the trees in Eviternity 2
  MAP14).
