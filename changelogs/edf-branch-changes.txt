===============================================================================
This log contains a summary  of changes performed in the edf-branch to obtain
fully additive processing of EDF lumps, additive logic for state definitions,
and functional DECORATE state support. edf-branch spans SVN revisions from
1014 to 1244.
===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/23/10

DECORATE states are now fully functional and have been tested to an almost full
extent (only a few features remain untried so far).

Linux errors and warnings in edf-branch have been repaired in preparation for
merger with trunk.

Gez noticed that I hadn't allowed for non-specification of the action at the
end of DECORATE states, but this turned out to be simple to fix with addition
of a state transition from PSTATE_NEEDBRIGHTORACTION back to the core looping
state, PSTATE_NEEDLABELORKWORSTATE, along with a call to the new subroutine
PSWrapStates, which is now executed at all three places that a state 
defintion can be terminated with an EOL token.

Later on I discovered an error in the tokenizer that was leaving out '.'
characters from tokens. This caused a Death.Fire state added to the DoomImpTest
object for testing purposes to appear under the name DeathFire.

I hoisted a call to M_QStrAtoi out of the state run-down loop in the parser
state callback for PSTATE_NEEDSTATETICS, which was a minor efficiency booboo.

Last of all, I created a separate e_dstate.c module and moved all DECORATE
state parsing and processing code into that module and out of the now
overgrown e_states.c.

Visual C++ 6.0 project files have been updated to build edf-branch. The branch
is now ready for merger with trunk. This is the termination of this log file,
and this branch of independent development.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/22/10

Significant work has been completed on the DECORATE parser, and it is now at
an approximate 80% completion. Code is present to generate the full "DSO," or
Decorate State Ouput object, which contains the following outputs:

* A list of "edecstate_t" objects, which consist of a label string and a state
  pointer. These are states which should be bound to the data structure that
  owns the DECORATE state block. They may be either native states or metatable
  states, and that determination will be made in the calling module.
  
* A list of "egoto_t" objects, which consist of a goto destination label and
  a pointer to a state_t's "nextstate" field. These represent goto labels
  which could not be resolved to state-block-local labels during DECORATE
  parsing. These labels must be resolved by the calling module, as they refer
  to states implicitly defined through native state fields or through mobjinfo
  inheritance.
  
* A list of "ekillstate_t" objects, which consist of a simple label name. 
  These represent states which should be removed or nullified in the context
  of the object that owns the state block. These are generated when the "stop"
  keyword is used immediately after a label.
  
No code to free the DSO object or other data structures generated during
DECORATE state parsing is yet present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/21/10

Merged from trunk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/02/10

Merged from trunk. Completed DECORATE parsing for "principals," which are the
numbers of various definition types that need to be allocated, as well as a
clean simple list of "buffered state" objects that represent labels, states,
and keywords in the order in which they were defined by the state block.

I will be able to run down this buffered state list during a secondary parsing
run to do the arbitrary look-forward required for state population, and the
deferred transition required for label resolution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/27/10

Merged from trunk. Added \n's to all libConfuse error messages, carrying on
similar work that was done in trunk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/25/10

Added support for boolean "flag" options to EDF, which set a boolean value to
either true or false simply by existing in the file, or by being prefaced with
a + or - depending on the cfg_opt_t entry's flags. This allows matching syntax
for DECORATE booleans and flag fields. This syntax is not yet used for any EDF
fields, but I will be changing that soon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/22/10

Merged from trunk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/17/10

edf-branch has been merged with the result of the merger between trunk and
SoM's critical experimental branch which added support for tall textures,
flat and wall texture interchangeability, etc. Only a few conflicts resulted
in the branch, which I easily resolved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/05/10 - 05/04/10

Merges from trunk, but no additional progress has been made. A number of 
problems in the processing of DECORATE states have caused me to repeatedly
restart and abandon various approaches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/04/10

Defined E_ReallocStates, which attempts to resize the states[] pointer array
intelligently based on the current size of states[] and the number of states
that are being added. The logic is such that states[] can actually be larger
than NUMSTATES - the extra state_t pointers are all nullified and shouldn't be
accessed by any properly behaved code.

Started work on DECORATE state label collection, and started writing the
E_CreateDECORATEStates function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/01/10

Merged from trunk. States are now fully dynamic and additive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/30/10

Random sound lists were being leaked if the sound definitions were overwritten
by newer EDF definitions of the same name.

States now use the universal ehash_t data structure for hashing, and duplicate
DeHackEd numbers are now allowed for states. The newest state seen with a given
DeHackEd number "wins" that number, the same way that all other hashes are 
handled in Eternity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/29/10

In a similar vein to the clearing of argument evaluation caching, I have 
eliminated the caching of state lookups in all action functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/28/10

Merged from trunk. Cached EDF argument evaluations are now cleared when EDFs
are processed at runtime via runtime wad loading, to ensure that any name-to-
number lookups they performed are re-evaluated in the face of altered EDF
definitions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/27/10

I replaced Lee's state cycle detection mechanism in P_SetMobjState with a
freelist-based solution which tracks the visited states in seenstate_t 
structures instead of using giant NUMSTATES-sized arrays which would not be
compatible with fully dynamic states. I believe this is ultimately a more
efficient solution and would have made sense even in the absence of the current
work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/25/10

Storage of sprite names in memory has been merged into the storage for the
esprite_t objects, to avoid unnecessary increase in the amount of memory
allocations.

Fixed a bug with sprite definitions that would have caused any sprites defined
within runtime-loaded EDF lumps to make the game exit with an error message
referring to there being no spritenames defined via the spritenames array.

The old binary TERTYPES lump, which was already deprecated and undocumented, is
now obsoleted and will not be loaded in any fashion. It is no longer possible 
to safely process it due to the way in which additive EDF processing works.

I eliminated the redundant TRUE and FALSE defines used in d_deh.c while
cleaning up some code in there that deals with sprite names, It has been 
transitioned to use the engine-standard boolean enumeration typedef instead.

In preparation for making states fully dynamic, I have added an oldaction field
to state_t that stores the prior value of the state's action pointer when that
pointer has been displaced via DeHackEd/BEX. This eliminates the runtime-fixed
size deh_codeptrs array entirely.

All use of NUMSTATES as a value meaning "state not found" has been replaced
with use of the value -1 instead, as was previously done in trunk on the way to
making sprites fully dynamic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/24/10

I moved the esprite_t structure into e_sprite.c from the header, as I don't
anticipate that it should be needed externally at all (all external access to
sprites is only concerned with the sprite name string itself).

I made a lot of the include tracking code functions in e_edf static to that
module, since they didn't end up being needed externally.

All included EDF files and lumps will now be listed in the verbose log file at
the head of the file, including the full path and SHA-1 hash of each data
source.

Support for parsing additional EDF definitions from lumps in wads loaded at
runtime has been restored to full functionality.

States have been modified so that they implicitly define any undefined sprite
name that they reference, with use of the new E_ProcessSingleSprite function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/23/10

With completion of the core EDF restructuring project, it is now possible to
begin work on revamping sprite handling. Sprite processing is being moved to
the previously created but unused e_sprite.c module.

With completion of dynamic sprites, the spritenames array in EDF will now only
be used to define the sprite names which must be in a certain order: chiefly,
the original DOOM sprite names. Other sprites will be definable within states
implicitly, though this is not yet enabled within the state processing code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/22/10

Core EDF restructuring is complete with full consolidation of the parsing of
root EDFs and independent EDF lumps into a single parsing pass followed by a
single processing pass, accumulating all definitions into a single cfg_t object
instead of using separate ones for the root and for each lump.

All default fallback processing code in e_edf and in the other e_ modules has
been fully removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/21/10

Performed the first series of mergers from trunk to edf-branch in order to
keep it up-to-date.

I added support for data sources to the DWFILE IO abstraction, although this
isn't currently used anywhere, and cannot currently be used by the EDF parser
due to some limitations and assumptions it makes about files vs lumps.

All the code being shared between cfg_parse and cfg_parselump has been merged
into a new cfg_parse_dwfile function to avoid unnecessary duplication of logic
being added there now.

cfg_parselump has now been modified to accept a lumpnum parameter rather than
doing its own W_GetNumForName operation, as it can no longer assume it is 
dealing with the root lump of the hash chain for that lump name.

I eliminated a potential double-free in the otherwise highly secure qstring
module in M_QStrFree, so that I can call that function on a qstring without
having to make sure it was actually allocated first.

Started work on E_CheckRoot to support conditional inclusion and hashing of
files through the root EDF (be it base/root.edf or an EDFROOT lump). As part
of this I added a lexer file open callback mechanism to libConfuse. A function
pointer is passed down through the cfg_t structure to the lexer, and the lexer
will call that function any time it opens a file for processing within that
cfg_t. The E_CheckRoot function, which will perform hashing and verification
for the root files, is registered as the callback for all cfg_t's employed
within EDF parsing.

I have eliminated all separate options arrays used for parsing separate EDF
lumps, as these are no longer needed under the new scheme which allows all
definitions in any lump name. I have also removed all the arrays that supported
"default fallbacks" parsing, as the notion of retroactively including new EDF
modules into old broken EDFs that did not use stdinclude("root.edf") to get to
the standard definitions is no longer supportable.

I also created an E_CreateCfg function that takes responsibility for allocation
and initialization of cfg_t structures for the core EDF parsing process.

E_ParseEDFLump has been made fully recursive in order to enable additive 
processing of independent EDF lumps, a major milestone for this branch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/19/10

Added a W_GetLumpNameChain function to replace several code segments throughout
the engine which are doing a specific sequence of actions to get the start of
the wad lump hash chain for a particular lump name, as this operation is going
to be needed as part of recursive processing of EDF lumps.

bex_include and include_prev are now deprecated functions. The former is 
deprecated because it is preferential to include BEX as DEHACKED lumps inside
wads, or to make reference to them via a GFS script, and the latter is 
deprecated because it has been superceded by automatic recursive processing of
all EDF lumps. include_prev is still syntactically recognized, but is actually
a no-op function now aside from printing a deprecation warning to the verbose
log file.

Added E_FindLumpInclude function, and restricted EDFs to inclusion of lumps
ONLY within the same physical wad file (or eventually other archive types).
This is required in order to establish a well-defined oldest-to-newest parsing
order when multiple EDF-bearing wads are loaded at one time.

With this restriction, EDF loading functions as such:

1. EDFROOT [oldest wad]
    |
    |- lumps included from this EDFROOT
    |
2. EDFROOT [other wads...]
    |
    |- lumps included from this EDFROOT
    |
N. EDFROOT [newest wad]
    |
    |- lumps included from this EDFROOT

Without the restriction, what lump is included from what EDFROOT becomes 
entirely arbitrary and will more than likely result in undefined situations
(from an EDF coder's viewpoint) that simply cause the EDF processor to error 
out complaining about missing definitions.

Doing it this way provides the best, most predictable results. Independent
EDF lumps which call include function in the same manner. This was discussed
with several core users on IRC and all of them agreed that this was the best
course of action.

Changed some possibly undefined behavior in M_ExtractFileBase.

I also fixed a serious potential memory corruption error caused by the call to
M_AddDefaultExtension in W_AddFile. BOOM team was extremely lax with the use
of strcat in this function. If all strings passed to W_AddFile do not have
room for an additional ".wad" to be added to them if they're missing it, this
would cause memory corruption, quite likely on the stack. This probably 
should have been fixed in trunk instead, but so far it's never caused an
error so I considered it low enough priority to just fix here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/18/10

Finished E_OpenAndCheckInclude, which opens the desired included file or lump,
computes its SHA-1 checksum, and then compares that code against a cache of
codes for previous data sources. If a match is found, the function silently 
fails and the data source will not be included again. If no match is found, the
new source is loaded as the current include for the lexer and is added to the
cache of hashed data sources.

Still needed is logic to do similar processing on files included as part of the
root EDF.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/17/10

I split cfg_lexer_include into several functions, including new functions
cfg_lexer_open and cfg_lexer_mustopen to provide some separation between the
actual opening of a file and verification that the file has been opened, since
under the new processing system, EDF will ignore any files that are attempted
for inclusion that it has already parsed, powered by storing SHA-1 hashes for
each data source.

Changed lexer_buffer_curfile into lexer_buffer_file, since the file it is now
buffering may or may not become the current file being parsed.

Fixed a very minor memory leak in E_BuildDefaultFn by making it use the newer
M_StringAlloca function instead of a qstring.

Added a lexer.h header because the number of externs from lexer.c being 
declared at the top of confuse.c finally became unruly enough to require it.
There were previously only two externs in this module, so I considered it
unjustified before.

With all of these changes in place, I was able to start work on the include
tracking code that will keep track of what files and lumps have already been
parsed into the EDF data hive using SHA-1 hash codes, and will reject any
subsequent inclusions of those data sources. As a means toward this end,
cfg_lexer_mustopen will now return the size of the data it has included in 
the *len parameter if that parameter is non-NULL. This is needed so that the 
size of the file can be sent to the m_hash routines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/16/10

I have eliminated the long redundant and unused caching of DWFILE pointers in
the libConfuse lexer's include stack structure. I have modified D_OpenFile and
D_OpenLump in the DWFILE abstraction to memset the DWFILE structure for safety.
I also changed all uses of char * to the more type-size-agnostic byte * in the
z_native module, though this really should have been done in trunk. Another
change that should have been in trunk was changing Cardboard so that it does
not store ints into the float openings array.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/15/10

Kicked things off by performing the promised deprecation for use of stdinclude
on any filename that does not contain "root.edf". This is in order to ensure
backward and forward compatibility is maintained by EDF mods by forcing them
not to assume anything about the presence or structure of any other EDF files
in the base directory, which was previously allowed but discouraged.

I removed special treatment of \f characters in the libConfuse lexer, since I
really don't know what a \f even is, and it shouldn't be in an EDF file.

I added the m_hash.c module which I wrote several months ago which provides a
generic data hash structure that can be initialized to use one of several
streaming hash algorithms - CRC-32, Adler32, MD5, and SHA-1 are supported.
This code was originally written for EE's future zip-based savegame format,
and will most likely still find use there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/12/10

Created edf-branch at SVN revision 1014 in order to work on transforming EDF to
support fully additive loading logic, which is a prerequisite to support for
DECORATE state syntax within thingtype blocks.
