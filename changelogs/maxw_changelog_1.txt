================================================================================
Changes since Eternity Engine v3.40.48 (older source comments with dates may be
removed and placed in maxw_changelog_0.txt, if need be)
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/09/19

Added two new codepointers: "A_CounterJumpEx", and "A_CounterSwitchEx".
These function similarly to their non-Ex counterparts, but are useable in
monsters defined fully using DECORATE states. CounterSwitchEx notably takes
args[0] as the counter # to use, and args[N] as the offset or state label to
jump to, and the number of states does not need to be specified.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/09/28

Altered IWAD detection so that FreeDM and Freedoom 2 are now  in the correct
positions when autodetected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/10/16

Locked parameterised doors now rely on the presence of a thinker to determine
whether or not to draw the door-activating line as coloured. Also 1S lines are
now correctly coloured if they have a locked parameterised action.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/11/20

ANIMATED entries are now discarded if either texture/flat is invalid.
Previously if the first was valid and the last wasn't then it would animate
through every texture/flat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/11/26

Add scaling for flats, via ExtraData and UDMF. This works on both slopes and
regular flats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/12/24

Over the course of the week sorted out x64 compilation under MSVC. This has
also been ported so that ACSVM branch compiles under x64 as well. One of the
more notable changes is that there are now batch scripts that handle use of the
MIDL compiler (the MIDL commands used originally were lost).

The README has also been updated to reflect the fact that the vc2012 no longer
exists.

Happy holidays to all, and to all a happy new year (well those of you that use
the Gregorian calendar at least)!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/03

Fixed 64-bit savegame loading thanks to Doomworld Forums user, grommile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/04

Fixed an invalid access in DWFILE::getStr thanks to GitHub user, worktycho.
Previously if size == 0 then inp would be invalid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/05

Fixed a value/range check in SaveArchive::archiveSave.

Add Plane_Copy. It copies slopes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/06

Updated the credits screen to include myself, and amend Sarah Mancuso's name.
The credits now have two names per column, and are separated down the middle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/08
Fixed CMake for Windows VS2015 generation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/13
Added thing specials, made them activate on death. Useable in UDMF and
ExtraData.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/14
Added ZDoom codepointer, A_SetSpecial. Fixed x/y offsets on png's being broken.
They're now no longer sunk into the floor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/21
Allow playback of slightly faulty wav files, such as those in Darch's Preacher
BOOM mapset.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/23
Allow for the specific ACS versions of Scroll_Floor and Scroll_Ceiling. This is
achieved by introducing a separate line bindings specifically for ACS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/29
Made it so transparent paletted PNGs are now correctly converted to patches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/02
Starting delimiters are now no longer skipped, except for some demos where it's
needed. It also is heuristically checked, so that the performance increase can
still occur if using new versions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/05
Fixed demo desync issue brought up here:
https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1713773

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/06
Fixed pickups so that the player that picks up the pickup is considered the
activator.

Fixed P_CheckPositionExt considering the check in the current sector the Mobj
is in, as opposed to where the x and y args are.

Add a 4th arg to A_Scratch, which designates means-of-death. This is achieved
by referring to the key (string), or the "num" property (int).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/10
inventory-branch-2016
Fixed item use in demos

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/11
inventory-branch-2016
Fixed item use in netgames, changed the itemID in ticcmd_t from int8_t to
uint16_t. To compensate, the ticcmd itemID is 1 higher than it should be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/12
inventory-branch-2016
Fixed picking up an item higher-priority than the currently-selected item not
updating the inv_ptr

Fixed loading not setting the visual inv_ptr.

Beautified some code so that it now uses E_EffectForIndex where appropriate,
instead of for ID.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/13
inventory-branch-2016
Made E_MoveInventoryCursor sane.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/03/26

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/04/22
Allowed UDMF->ExtraData special lookup to work, for SetLineSpecial.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/05/21
Fixed Thing_Remove not cleaning up properly. Thing_Remove'd stuff would still
be targeted by monsters even after removal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/06/04
Added sector scroller UDMF properties, and fixed ACS scroll speeds. Also fixed
overriding that the ACS specials do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/07/18
Tall and transparent PNGs are now supported, though the transparency could do
with being mask-based, instead of just using a "this is transparent" index.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/08/04
ALT+F4 now exits the program in a quick and clean fashion. Thanks to anotak for
bringing this up.

Fixed ACS scrollers again.
