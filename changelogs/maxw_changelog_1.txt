================================================================================
Changes since Eternity Engine v3.40.48 (older source comments with dates may be
removed and placed in maxw_changelog_0.txt, if need be)
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/09/19

Added two new codepointers: "A_CounterJumpEx", and "A_CounterSwitchEx".
These function similarly to their non-Ex counterparts, but are useable in
monsters defined fully using DECORATE states. CounterSwitchEx notably takes
args[0] as the counter # to use, and args[N] as the offset or state label to
jump to, and the number of states does not need to be specified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/09/28

Altered IWAD detection so that FreeDM and Freedoom 2 are now in the correct
positions when autodetected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/10/16

Locked parameterised doors now rely on the presence of a thinker to determine
whether or not to draw the door-activating line as coloured. Also 1S lines are
now correctly coloured if they have a locked parameterised action.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/11/20

ANIMATED entries are now discarded if either texture/flat is invalid.
Previously if the first was valid and the last wasn't then it would animate
through every texture/flat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/11/26

Add scaling for flats, via ExtraData and UDMF. This works on both slopes and
regular flats.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016/12/24

Over the course of the week sorted out x64 compilation under MSVC. This has
also been ported so that ACSVM branch compiles under x64 as well. One of the
more notable changes is that there are now batch scripts that handle use of the
MIDL compiler (the MIDL commands used originally were lost).

The README has also been updated to reflect the fact that the vc2012 no longer
exists.

Happy holidays to all, and to all a happy new year (well those of you that use
the Gregorian calendar at least)!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/03

Fixed 64-bit savegame loading thanks to Doomworld Forums user, grommile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/04

Fixed an invalid access in DWFILE::getStr thanks to GitHub user, worktycho.
Previously if size == 0 then inp would be invalid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/05

Fixed a value/range check in SaveArchive::archiveSave.

Add Plane_Copy. It copies slopes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/06

The credits screen now includes myself and I amended Sarah Mancuso's name.
The credits now have two names per column and are separated down the middle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/08
Fixed CMake for Windows VS2015 generation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/13
Added thing specials, made them activate on death. Useable in UDMF and
ExtraData.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/14
Added ZDoom codepointer, A_SetSpecial. Fixed x/y offsets on png's being broken.
They're now no longer sunk into the floor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/21
Allow playback of slightly faulty wav files, such as those in Darch's Preacher
BOOM mapset.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/23
Allow for the specific ACS versions of Scroll_Floor and Scroll_Ceiling. This is
achieved by introducing a separate line bindings specifically for ACS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/01/29
Made it so transparent paletted PNGs are now correctly converted to patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/02
Starting delimiters are now no longer skipped, except for some demos where it's
needed. It also is heuristically checked, so that the performance increase can
still occur if using new versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/05
Fixed demo desync issue brought up here:
https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1713773

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/02/06
Fixed pickups so that the player that picks up the pickup is considered the
activator.

Fixed P_CheckPositionExt considering the check in the current sector the Mobj
is in, as opposed to where the x and y args are.

Add a 4th arg to A_Scratch, which designates means-of-death. This is achieved
by referring to the key (string), or the "num" property (int).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/03/26
Added solutions and folders for Visual Studio 2017.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/04/22
Allowed UDMF->ExtraData special lookup to work, for SetLineSpecial.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/05/21
Fixed Thing_Remove not cleaning up properly. Thing_Remove'd stuff would still
be targeted by monsters even after removal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/06/04
Added sector scroller UDMF properties, and fixed ACS scroll speeds. Also fixed
overriding that the ACS specials do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/07/18
Tall and transparent PNGs are now supported, though the transparency could do
with being mask-based, instead of just using a "this is transparent" index.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/08/04
ALT+F4 now exits the program in a quick and clean fashion. Thanks to anotak for
bringing this up.

Fixed ACS scrollers again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/08/26
The player view no longer vibrates once their decapitated head hits the floor,
if they have interpolation on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/08/27
Console aliases for idk and idfa have been added: "givearsenal" and "givekeys"
respectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/09/06
Fixed UDMF damageinterval having a default of 0 when it should be 32.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/09/12
Building with Visual Studio no longer includes any batch files. Both Eternity
and midiproc both use the "MIDL" section in project properties.

Removed the ability to pick internal texture format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/11/10
Merged in SDL2 branch. Changes I can remember:
 • Moved to SDL 2.0.7, SDL_mixer 2.0.2, and SDL_net 2.0.1
 • "unicodeinput" is gone. All text input is UTF-8.
 • -8in32 and the software bitdepth setting are gone.
 • A new console variable "displaynum" exists, and lets you set what display
   the window is created on when you run Eternity.
 • A new console command "maxdisplaynum" has been added (guess what it does).
 • -directx and -gdi are gone.

Also whilst I was at it I added a fullscreen toggle,
bound to Alt+Enter on non-Apple, Cmd+f on Apple).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/01/31
Changed GL extensions and pixelbuffers to be on by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/02/05
Fixed hitscan impact not activating lines that only have impact activation in
UDMF. This means that players always activate them now (with impact), as do
monsters with SPAC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/02/07
Fix EV_ThingSpawn not assigning tid of spawned mobj.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/02/10
Fixed lumps in the HI_ markers overriding regular textures. This means that
wads like Bloody Steel don't have invisible menu options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/02/14
Added a "restartmap" command. It's basically the same as using the "map"
command but to the same level.

================================================================================

P-A-N-S-H-O-P-A-N-S-H-O-P-A-N-S-H-O-P-A-N  
 
MAJOR CHANGES:
 • Introduced EDF weapons:
  - Users can now define brand new weapons.
  - All the original Doom weapons are now defined through this system.
  - Almost all Heretic weapons are now defined through this system (the others
    aren't defined at all).
  - Almost all of the Heretic weapon codepointers have been added.
  - Additionally, weapondeltas have been added.
 • Introduced EDF pickupeffects:
  - Users can now define brand new pickups.
  - These can define either thing-based or sprite-based pickups. They can also
    be defined externally, or inside a thingtype definition.
  - They encompass health, armor, ammo, power-ups, weapons, and artefacts.
  - All the Doom and Heretic pickups now use this system.  
  - PICKUPITEMS ARE DEPRECATED, PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM.
 • Introduced support for Heretic-style inventory
  - Items can only be used in Heretic at the moment, but support will be
    extended to other IWADs.
  - All the Heretic artefacts now use this system (except for the egg).
 • EDF playerclasses now have more options.
 • Added EDF playerdeltas.
 
There's probably more stuff I'm forgetting but that's the big stuff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/04/07
Splitted armor's +bonus into +additive and -setabsorption.
Added the RAMBO cheat from Heretic, and improved givearsenal to give armor in
Heretic too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/05/17
Added EDF fontdeltas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/06/13
Changed version name to "Tyrfing".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/06/16
Made A_Jump now work for weapons with DECORATE states.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/07/20
Add support for the Rekkr stand-alone IWAD.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/07/01
Added r_drawplayersprites, which lets players choose to not render weapons if
they don't want to (for example, if taking photos).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/07/23
Fix ev_text events causing some issues, such as menu navigation occurring when
inserting specific keys for key bindings on certain menus.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/12/02
The edf "include" directive can now include files with longer names or using
paths (e.g.: "whereveredfis/monsters/somethingidunno.edf"). This is
case-insensitive, and all \s are converted to /s when internally hashed.
Additionally these includes are relative to the file making the include
(e.g: if "edf/monsters.edf" does "include("monsters/something.edf")" it will
include "edf/monsters/something.edf"). Includes can be made non-relative by
putting a '/' before the rest of the path.

. AND .. ARE NOT SUPPORTED!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/12/18
Re-implemented the MBF pickups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/12/25
Merry Christmas!
Added the new Modern HUD (with graphics courtesy of ptoing), which supports all
the layouts the BOOM HUD does as well. Along with this the Modern HUD and flat
layouts have been made to be the new default for overlay-style HUDs.
Added an inventory bar to Doom. Currently it only works when not using the
regular Doom HUD, and currently selected items are not rendered  outside of
when the inventory bar is active.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019/01/11
Fixed the FOV parameter for A_JumpIfTargetInLOS, which was read in as an int
FRACUNIT times smaller than it should have been before being converted to an
angle. It is now read in as a fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019/01/13
Added SetWeapon and CheckWeapon ACS functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019/01/14
Added SetWeapon and CheckWeapon ACS functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019/01/26
Greatly improved performance of R_doubleToUint32, which becomes significantly
noticeable in maps with lots of flats (think central area of Mothership).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019/02/05
Add range parameter to A_CustomPlayerMelee. This displaces the new-ish pufftype
parameter, punting that to last position.
