Changes since Eternity Engine v3.37.00
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/23/10

Removed a bizarre and incorrect toggle-on of the comp_zombie variable for demo
versions 200 through 202 which was either adapted blindly - or incorrectly -
from an early PrBoom version many years ago, and prevented all suicide and death
exits from functioning during -complevel 9 demo playback. 

This allows 30sdx2556.lmp to sync up until MAP11, at which point the player 
takes a sudden dive into a nukage river and then dies near some blue key bars 
after hurting himself with a rocket. I am told an Arch-vile jump is supposed to 
take place at the point where he falls into the river, so we probably have some
enemy behavior or clipping engine differences yet to be accounted for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/20/10

Due to continuing and probably only worse-in-the-future issues with the C99
standard's refusal to provide ANY mechanism for structured type punning, 
something that Eternity had come to rely heavily upon to allow object-oriented
techniques to be applied in C, we have made the decision to move to C++.

This effort has begun with a new cpp-branch. Development on that branch will be
logged to a separate changelog file on that branch, which will eventually be
merged back into trunk once it is sufficiently stable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/11/10

Again by request I've added an alpha field and ADDITIVE extflag value for
ExtraData linedefs, which enable use of flex translucency and additive blending
with lines. This has been technologically possible for years but I never got
around to adding a good way to access it, partly for lack of ideas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/08/10

We have merged portal-clip branch into EE prematurely in order to pull in 
support for portaly overlays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/06/10

Invalid subsector references will now be cleansed from the BSP tree, in order to
prevent access violations that will otherwise occur. This stops the long-noted
segmentation violation/venetian blinds crash in DEEPCRE.WAD's E1M1, which has an
invalid BSP tree in only one subsector, which consists of a single seg making
up a door track (glitchy node builder I suppose, probably didn't properly handle
degenerate subsectors).

Fixed a control path not returning a value in stopchan, which I recently rewrote
to help stop sound stuttering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/05/10

Essel also found Cardboard glitches with respect to splitting visplanes and
drawing of segs across which the only differences were the angles of flats.
Somehow these checks got left out.

EE has hit r1337!

Added support for an MF4_BRIGHT flag by request. This flag can turn an object
fullbright on all of its frames without requiring the entire set of frames to
be manually altered to use the "bright" flag.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/31/10

Happy Halloween! Level-error-related console error messages have been improved
to include the numbers/indices of offending structures in the map in most cases.

I removed dependency on host ability to perform unaligned reads from the
GetLevelWord/DWord routines for additional portability.

I was getting severe stuttering in the sound engine and I suspected that it 
might be related to the recent d_fastrefresh tweak - possibly the main thread 
running in such a tight fast loop is pre-empting the sound update thread too 
often.

I moved reclamation of stopped sound channels, which can block the sound update
loop explicitly, out of the main loop and into I_StartSound, so that sound
channels are reclaimed when they are actually needed, and not constantly polled
for having been stopped. It seems to have stopped the stuttering.

esselfortium's ExtraData test map also uncovered a bug with skies and colormaps
which caused the last sector drawn's colormap to apply to all skies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/25/10

An ugly bug surfaced today - when I rewrote cvars to support defaults properly,
I forgot that ct_constant cvars have value pointers. This was causing an access
violation if you tried to display the value of any constant, such as ver_name,
ver_date, or creator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/24/10

Adjusted some ExtraData keywords for readability. Added proper support for 
multiple-level PWADs to the Master Levels / managed wad directory system, so 
that TEETH.WAD is now fully playable. Along with this tweak I added an optional
parameter to the w_startlevel command that allows starting a specific map from
a managed wad directory. So for example one can use the console command 

$ "w_startlevel teeth.wad MAP31"

and proceed directly to the secret level. The file named has to be in the 
directory currently enumerated by the Master Levels directory setting, of
course. Perhaps in the future Eternity can maintain additional enumerated
directories?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/19/10

Some problems with inputting blank values into the menu system that have existed
since the SMMU rewrite of the mess in MBF were resolved by adding a 
cf_allowblank console variable flag. Variables with that flag receive special
treatment in the menu system.

You can now escape or backspace out of the Master Levels menu after finishing a
level, and you will return to the title screen.

File paths are now displayed in the menu using "smart" truncation. While viewing
the item, the right-hand side of the string will be truncated to a fixed margin
and a ... will be appended. While editing the string, the input caret will not
pass beyond the same margin, and instead, the displayed portion of the string is
ran forward, and the left side is truncated with an ellipsis. This keeps your
typing in view no matter how long the string is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/17/10

ExtraData sectors have now been completed with addition of support for 
overriding the TerrainTypes of a sector on a per-surface basis. I also repaired
a long-standing bug in the routine used to retrieve a terrain given an mobj_t
which considered only the thing's subsector, and not the floor it was standing
on. Because of the need for a demo comp check for this, I have bumped up the
version to 3.39.21. I also created some new macros, maek_full_version and
full_demo_version, that resolve long-standing problems with being able to 
easily compare demo versions down to the subversion level (not to be confused
with Subversion, as we do not track SVN revisions in the source currently).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/12/10

I decided to break up the various p_?enemy modules into smaller a_ modules that
contain various types of codepointers, some by game, and others by specific
ranges of functionality. The breakdown is as follows:

* a_counters.c - contains Eternity 'counter assembly' pointers
* a_common.c   - contains basic pointers shared by all games like A_Chase
* a_decorate.c - contains ZDoom-inspired, DECORATE-compatible pointers
* a_doom.c     - DOOM gamecode
* a_general.c  - Eternity generalized/parameterized pointers
* a_heretic.c  - Heretic gamecode
* a_hexen.c    - Hexen gamecode (very tenative; do not use!!!)

Yagisan has completely revamped the CMake system so that it is operational with
his automated compiler farm. This has extended support to some additional
platforms and brought in some additional warning and error fixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/11/10

Finally got back around to work on ExtraData sectors, possibly one of the most
put-off-after-being-started features in Eternity's history. I can't even 
remember when I started writing the code for these, but more and more things
just kept getting in the way. esselfortium needs flat offsets and rotation for
his uber-detailed slopes, though, and doesn't want to wait for UDMF to start
using them, so I'm pushing it through.

Started off by getting the parsing of sector flag fields functional, and loading
up offsets and floor/ceiling angles into the mapsectorext_t structure, which is
right where I left off before. I have also written a routine which will reverse
the angles into a clockwise orientation, in order to match ZDoom, which for
some reason I simply don't understand, considers flat rotation angles in the
opposite direction of DOOM's natural 3D coordinate system... so don't blame me.
I figured it would cause the least headaches in the future with UDMF 
interoperability if I chose to do it the same way in ExtraData.
