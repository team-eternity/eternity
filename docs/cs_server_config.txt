/**** "masters"

/**** "resources"
** An array of WADs and other resource files (DEH/BEX files for instance) that
** the server will load.  The "alternates" option is optional, and provides an
** array of acceptable alternate resources.  Normally clients cannot connect
** unless they load exactly the same resources as the server; this allows some
** freedom in that regard.  Typically alternates are freedoom and various "vox"
** WADs.
**
** Example:
*/

    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "doom2.wad",

        },

** You'll notice that "dwango5.wad" and "greenwar.wad" are simple strings,
** compared to the full objects used for "doom2.wad", "zvox2.wad" and
** "420.deh".  If your resource is a WAD (not an IWAD) and you aren't
** specifying any alternates for it, you can simply define it using a string.
** IWADs must be specified using the long format, and their type (obviously)
** must be "iwad".
*/

/**** "server"
** An object containing all the global server options, as in these options
** cannot be changed on a per-map basis in the "overrides" section.  These
** options all have defaults and are optional.  The "write_config_to" option
** deserves special mention; it will write the server's JSON configuration data
** (that clients use to connect to it) to the specified (full path) file.
**
** Authorization is fairly simple.  Four authorization levels are provided:
** spectator, player, moderator and administrator.  Spectators can connect and
** watch the game, but cannot join it.  Players can join the game, but cannot
** use any RCON commands.  Moderators can change maps and the map list, as well
** as kick and ban/unban players.  Administrators can run all RCON commands.
** Setting "spectator_password" requires that players authenticate before they
** can even connect to the server.  If "spectator_password" is set, but 
** "player_password" isn't, then clients only need a password to connect, not
** play - any connected client can become a player.  "moderator_password" and
** "administrator_password" are required; the server will quit with an error if
** they are not defined.
**
** A quick note about "max_player_clients", "max_admin_clients" and
** "max_players":
**   - "max_player_clients" is the number of non-admin clients that can be
**      connected to the server.
**   - "max_admin_clients" is the number of admin client spots to reserve.
**   - MAX_CLIENTS is the sum of "max_player_clients" and "max_admin_clients",
**     and is the true maximum number of clients that can be connected at any
**     given time.
**   - "max_players" and "max_players_per_team" are map-specific options (can
**     be changed on a per-map basis) and represent the maximum number of
**     players that have "joined the game" or "joined the game on a team".
**     Don't put "max_players" or "max_players_per_team" here in the server
**     section, they belong below in options and maps.
**   - If a player has passed through the queue and is eligible to play, but is
**     spectating, a timer will start to tick.  If the timer expires, the
**     player is sent back to the end of the queue, and the queue advances.
**     This time limit is configurable using "spectator_time_limit".  This does
**     not affect spectators who are not yet eligible to play.
