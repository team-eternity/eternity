### Master Server

#### Foreword

EE's master server is still in flux, and almost all of this is subject to
change.  However, the basic principles will remain the same: the server will
always be an HTTP server, the data format will always be JSON, and so on, but
details may change.  Current candidates include:

  - Adding a configurable limit on how many server groups an admin can have on
    the master at any one time; this would probably default to 4 or 5.  Admins
    can still create as many servers as they want, so this isn't as limiting as
    it seems.  It's certainly much better than the arbitrary limit on servers
    themselves used by ZDaemon's master.

#### Requirements

EE's master server is fundamentally a web application.  It requires:

  - A web server (tested with Apache 2.2.17 and `mod_wsgi` 3.3)
  - A database (tested with PostgreSQL 8.4)
  - Python (tested with 2.6, 2.5 and 2.7 probably work, 3.x does not)
  - web.py (tested with 0.34)
  - SQLAlchemy (tested with 0.6.5)
    - A driver for your database (tested with Psycopg2 2.0.14)

#### Web Server Issues

Below are some issues with the most popular web servers and their solutions.

##### Lighttpd

Version 1.4.20 and earlier of Lighttpd incorrectly handle HTTP 1.1 PUT requests.
The issue is that Lighttpd will respond to PUT requests containing the
"Expect: 100-continue" header with HTTP status code "417 Expectation failed".
The fix is to disable "server.reject-expect-100-with-417", which is only
available in versions 1.4.21 and later.  Add the following line to your
lighttpd.conf file:

    server.reject-expect-100-with-417 = "disable"

##### Apache

Apache will strip the "Authorization:" header from requests before the master
can handle it, thus causing all authentication attempts to fail.  Using
`mod_rewrite`, however, it is possible to replace the header.  Add the
following lines to your httpd.conf file:

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
    RewriteRule ^ - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1,L]

If you are using a VirtualHost, this should go in that section.  Otherwise
place it in the main body of the config.

#### Design and Benefits

The master tries to improve on the traditional multiplayer Doom master/launcher
design in a number of ways.

##### Requires no separate launcher program

Perhaps the most significant benefit is that a separate launcher program is not
required to show all active servers.  The master includes a JavaScript
"launcher" interface accessible at its root URL - this is described in more
detail in the **Player Usage** section.  Not requiring a launcher means less
code to write and maintain, and it's one less application the user has to
install and periodically update.  Of course, contemporary launchers are quite
full-featured, and the master's launcher is nowhere near a full replacement,
but there's nothing preventing those projects from adding support for EE;
indeed the hope is that doing so is easier than for other c/s Doom ports due to
the simplicity of the protocols & format.

##### Built on proven, robust technology

HTTP servers and SQL databases are technologies that have been used to handle
heavy load situations, and they both provide administrators great tools like
access controls and throttling to handle malicious users.

##### Unlimited servers

Other master server implementations limit the number of servers that
administrators can advertise to mitigate DoS attacks and spam, but EE's master
has other methods.

###### Defense against DoS attacks

All modern HTTP servers provide the ability to throttle their connections on a
number of different levels (per-connection, per IP address, etc.), making a DoS
attack difficult to execute successfully.

###### Defense against spam attacks

EE's master requires admins to register accounts before they advertise their
servers, and when they do advertise their servers, they're placed in their own
namespace.  For example, if a TotalTrash admin wants to advertise their
servers on a hypothetical master at `http://master.eternity.xxx`, they would
create the account `totaltrash`, and their servers would be located at
`http://master.eternity.xxx/servers/totaltrash`, which prevents namespace
collisions.  It is still possible for that admin to advertise a large amount of
bogus servers.  The master has a low timeout threshold, so such an attack has
to continually update the master with valid information for each bogus server.
Admittedly this isn't difficult to do, and handling spam attacks generally
requires intervention from the master's admin - usually account deletion.

##### Open protocols and format

The protocols/format used by EE's master are HTTP and JSON, both of which
are open and plain-text and consequently very easy to understand, troubleshoot,
and implement in a cross-platform, language-agnostic way.  Indeed libraries for
both HTTP and JSON exist for all mainstream programming languages.  The use of
URLs is also quite powerful, and described in more detail in the
**Player Usage** section.

##### Insulated servers

The launcher never contacts servers directly, and there is no way (other than
connecting with a client normally) for users to contact a server.  Servers send
state updates (how many players are playing, current frags/scores, etc.) to the
master periodically, which the master stores in the database and serves to the
launcher on request.

This is much easier on both the client and the game servers from a networking
perspective; the client doesn't open a large amount of socket connections and
servers aren't continuously bombarded by configuration requests.  Clients are
particularly susceptible to this as most launchers include an "auto-update"
feature that can query hundreds of servers while a player is connected to a
server and lag the player in the process.  Refreshing servers should also be
very fast - even if the information is somewhat out of date.

##### Accounts and authentication

Passwords are sent over the wire and stored using their SHA-1 hashes.  While
this adds nothing to the security of the master (sniffing the SHA-1 hash and
forging it is trivial), it does protect the user in case they are using this
password for other services, such as their e-mail account, bank account, et
cetera.  The JavaScript launcher holds the SHA-1 hash of the user's password
in memory; no cookies of any kind are used.

#### Player Usage

Players interact with the master largely through the JavaScript launcher
interface.

##### Launcher

The master comes with a JavaScript "launcher" interface accessible at its root
URL (i.e. `http://master.eternity.xxx/`).  This interface lists the server's
configuration (address, port, PWADs, etc.) and current state (players, frags,
etc.), and most importantly links pointing to JSON configuration data used to
join servers.  The client is registered to handle the `eternity:` protocol, and
launches a command-line like:

    eternity.exe -csjoin eternity://master.eecs.xxx/servers/totaltrash/ZDDL1

##### Downloading WADs

If a server has configured a URL at which to download PWADs (not IWADs), its
PWADs will be displayed as links in the interface for the user to download.
This removes the need for a separate application or library like GetWAD; users
can simply click on the links to download the WADs to their machines.

##### URLs

The master/launcher design is built around the URL.  Each server must belong to
a group, and its name is then listed beneath that group.  For example,
  TotalTrash's Private CTF server might have the following URL:

    eternity://master.eternity.xxx/servers/totaltrash/Private CTF

Pointing an HTTP client at this URL will return the server's configuration,
which is a short JSON document.  This document contains everything the client
needs to know in order to connect to the server.

Additionally, EE supports a wide range of protocols, including (but not limited
to) HTTP(S), FTP, and FILE.  This gives admins and users extreme flexibility,
indeed using URLs in this way has numerous benefits:

###### Storage is simple

Storing URLs is easy, and launching the client can be done in any number of
ways (apart from simply using the master's launcher):

  - Create a shortcut
    (`eternity.exe -csjoin "file://e:/Users/Kyte/eternity/servers/PCTF.json"`)
  - Create a bookmark in the browser
  - Create a script

Hopefully this puts the days of trying to remember IP addresses and ports in
the past for good.

###### Master servers are not required

Because clients only need a URL that points to JSON configuration data, a
master server is not required.  Admins can:

  - Paste the JSON configuration files into pastebin and post the URL
    (something like `http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Hf8Y37zc`)
  - Host their own webserver and configure their game servers to write the
    configuration files into a folder served by the webserver.

This means that server admins aren't at the mercy of master server admins, and
in the event of an outage can still "advertise" their servers.

#### Admin Usage

Server admins will also largely use the JavaScript launcher interface to
interact with the master.

##### Registration

Registration involves choosing a username & password, as well as supplying an
e-mail address (this reference implementation does not currently save or store
the e-mail address).  When the user supplies this information, the master will
send an e-mail containing a unique validation token ID URL; clicking this URL
validates the registration and the user can now create groups and advertise
servers.  Validation tokens are only valid for a short (configurable) period of
time.

This system is in place to prevent programmatic creation of accounts and avoid
a potential DoS attack (using up all the random validation tokens, using up all
the reasonable usernames, etc.).  In fact, the master server itself implements
a configurable delay on account creation so that the process is deliberately
slow - minimizing the amount of bogus accounts a malicious user could create in
a given period of time.

##### Advertising

Once registered, admins must specify their information in their server config
files (username, password, group and name).  Again, this is not necessary,
admins need only post their JSON configuration data for users to download.
However, the master provides a more full-featured interface than a simple list
of links, so it's thought that admins will prefer to advertise on a master.

Once advertised, servers send status updates every 2 seconds).  When a server
shuts down, it tells the master to remove it from the list.  The master will
not hang on to servers forever; it keeps track of updates and omits servers
that have gone without an update for a configurable period of time, which
should be at least 2 seconds... but generally should be around 3 or 4 seconds.

##### Server groups

Server groups determine what base URL their server URLs will use.  For example,
creating the group "idl" on "master.totaltrash.org" might yield a URL like:

    eternity://master.totaltrash.org/servers/idl/server 1

This prevents namespace collisions; "server 1" is a potentially common name,
and this allows server admins to be free in how they name their servers.

It's worth mentioning that "server 1" is not what's displayed on the master.
Servers have a "hostname" configuration attribute where a more descriptive name
can be specified, like "International Doom League - Server A - Fortress
Collision (MAP01)".  "server 1" would be specified in the "masters"
configuration section for that master.

See [cs_server_config.txt](cs_server_config.txt) for more information.

#### URL API

The master is built using the REST ideology, so it makes liberal use of lesser-
known HTTP verbs like PUT and DELETE that augment the well-known GET and POST.

  - GET /
    - Serves the JavaScript launcher application.
  - GET /registration/{id}
    - Validates a user's registration using the ID sent in the validation
      e-mail.
  - HEAD /users (requires parameter authentication)
    - A special URL & method provided so that JavaScript clients can
      authenticate using HTTP params instead of HTTP Basic Authentication;
      this avoids browser problems like attempting invalid authentication
      methods or popping up the ugly auth box.  The parameters are "username"
      and "password"; "username" expects the Base64-encoded username, and
      "password" expects the Base64-encoded SHA1 hash of the password.
  - GET /users/{name} (requires authentication)
    - Returns a list of the user's groups as JSON data.
  - PUT /users/{name}
    - Creates a user (see documentation on the registration process above).
  - POST /users/{name} (requires authentication)
    - Changes a user's password.
  - DELETE /users/{name} (requires authentication)
    - Deletes a user, including all of their server groups and their servers.
  - GET /servers
    - Returns server information as JSON data.
  - GET /servers/{group}
    - Returns server information as JSON data for the specified group.
  - PUT /servers/{group} (requires authentication)
    - Creates a group.
  - DELETE /servers/{group} (requires group owner authentication)
    - Deletes a group and all servers contained therein.
  - GET /servers/{group}/{name}
    - Returns a server's configuration information as JSON data.
  - PUT /servers/{group}/{name} (requires group owner authentication)
    - Creates a server ("advertises" it).
  - POST /servers/{group}/{name} (requires group owner authentication)
    - Updates a server's state information.
  - DELETE /servers/{group}/{name} (requires group owner authentication)
    - Deletes a server.

The API was developed to be simple in the hope that programmers find it easy to
use or re-implement themselves.
