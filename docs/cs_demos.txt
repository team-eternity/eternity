### Network Demos

This document describes how network demos are implemented.

#### Fundamental Structure

A network demo only needs to contain four things:

  - Header
  - Input commands
  - Network messages
  - Console commands

Each of these will have a unique identifier, and the size of the data
immediately follows.  So something like (overly simplified):

    void CS_SaveCommandToDemo(cs_cmd_t *cmd)
    {
        *cs_demo_p++ = CS_DEMO_INPUT_COMMAND_MARKER;
        *cs_demo_p++ = sizeof(cs_cmd_t);
        memcpy(cs_demo_p++, cmd, sizeof(cs_cmd_t));
    }

#### Archive:

Fundamentally, a demo is all network messages and local player input received
during a single map as well as a header (described above).  However, demos can
only be distributed as members of a "demo archive", which is a TAR file with a
very specific structure.  The expected structure is:

  - 2011-01-02T17:52:01-05:00.emd
    - info.txt
    - 1
      - info.txt
      - toc.txt
      - log.txt
      - demodata.bin
      - save1.sav
      - save1.png
      - save2.sav
      - save2.png
      - saveN.sav
      - saveN.png
    - 2
      - ...
      - demodata.bin
      - ...

The ISO 8601 timestamp in the filename is to ensure that demo files are not
haphazardly overwritten, but it is not a requirement.  The archive splits up
the demo so that there's 1 demo for each map, and these demos are stored in
sequentially numbered folders.  The save games are used as checkpoints for
quick rewinding and fast-forwarding, and the screenshots and log will be useful
in various ways to users.

#### Top-Level info.txt Contents:

  - Version
  - Name
  - Author
  - Date Recorded

#### Per-map info.txt Contents:

  - Resources
    - name
    - type (IWAD/PWAD/DEH/BEX/EDF)
    - SHA-1 hash
  - Settings (basically JSON settings dump)
  - Length of Demo (in seconds)

This format will be easy to extend, so any field can be added.

##### toc.txt

"toc.txt" maps savegames to indices.  The main purpose of this is so that a
viewer knows at what point in the demo the savegame refers to, but the reason
for keeping the information separate is so that checkpoints can be added or
deleted by a viewer.

##### log.txt

"log.txt" contains the events that occurred during the game, such as
`[UD]Ladna was splattered by [UD]Ralphis' super shotgun.`, although I imagine I
might change exactly what these "events" are as time goes on, depending on what
is useful; I'm considering a JSON event format.

#### demo.bin:

"demo.bin" is the main demo file, and contains different things based on
whether the demo is a serverside or clientside demo.

  - Header
    - serverside or clientside (0, 1)
    - WADs (ordered, names and SHA-1 hashes).
    - Settings (`cs_settings` dump)
    - Map name.
    - Date/Time.
    - Length (indices).
  - Index.
    - Network Message.
    - Local Player Input Command.

#### Robustness

Clients should handle the absence of files other than "demo.bin" as gracefully
as possible; the only truly indispensible file is the demo itself - in fact,
all the information (save that found in "info.txt") can be re-created from the
demo.

#### Base Technologies (Archival/Compression)

As noted above, demos are TAR files.  By default, EE compresses the TAR files
using BZip2 compression, but any compression technology supported by libarchive
is supported for playback.  However, the basic TAR format must be preserved, it
cannot be replaced with ZIP or 7z, for example.
